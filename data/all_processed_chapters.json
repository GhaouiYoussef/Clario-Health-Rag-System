                "1": "Toolkit for analysis and use of routine health facility data Rationale for the toolkit Routine health facility data comprise data that are reported at regular intervals from facilities providing health services. The system of regular recording, reporting, analysis and presentation of health facility data is known as the routine health information system (routine health information system) . 1 routine health information system data provide a picture of the services delivered in health facilities and the health status of the people using the services. The data can be used to assess the performance of individual facilities and also to assess service utilization and coverage of interventions in defined populations. routine health information system data serve multiple users and a wide range of purposes including patient/client management, facility management, disease surveillance, monitoring of service provision and resource use, and planning, resource allocation and policy-making. Despite the importance of routine facility data and substantial investments in routine health information system over the years, many contexts continue to face multiple challenges related to routine health information system data, including: \u2022 a multiplicity of indicators, data elements and disaggregations (in part, resulting from increasing global reporting needs and stakeholder demands); \u2022 lack of standardization of indicators and data elements; \u2022 gaps in specific data types (e.g. community-based, hospital and quality of care data); \u2022 fragmentation and duplication of data systems (lack of interoperability); \u2022 poor data quality with resulting lack of trust in routine health information system data; \u2022 capacity gaps in data analysis, presentation and interpretation; and \u2022 failure to communicate data in formats that are appropriate to various users. At the Measurement for Accountability for Health Summit in 2015, United States Agency for International Development (United States Agency for International Development), World Health Organization and the World Bank called for action \u201cto improve health facility and community information systems including disease and risk surveillance and financial and health workforce accounts, empowering decision makers at all levels with real-time access to information.\u201d 2 In response, World Health Organization has led the development of the Toolkit for analysis and use of routine health facility data . 3 This initiative represents the collaborative efforts of multiple World Health Organization technical programmes and partners. The toolkit emphasizes standardization, integration and a focused approach to data analysis. It aims to focus the analysis of routine health information system data on a limited set of standardized indicators, using recommended standard analyses, visualizations and dashboards, and to provide guidance on data interpretation and use. 1 The routine health information system is also called the health management information system (health management information system). The term routine health information system is used throughout this document. 2 Health Measurement and Accountability Post 2015: Five-Point Call to Action, June 2015. 3 https://www.who.int/healthinfo/tools_data_analysis_routine_facility/en/ ",
                "2": "Structure of the toolkit Refer to the inside front cover of this document for an illustration of the toolkit contents. The toolkit consists of three parts, each of which contains a number of modules. Each module contains a guidance manual(s) and may also contain downloadable electronic dashboard packages (\u201cconfiguration packages\u201d) and training materials. Part 1: Standards for measurement and analysis This part provides foundations for analysis and use of routine health information system data that are applicable across all the toolkit modules . It includes three modules: \u2022 general principles, which discusses basic concepts for analysing routine health information system data; \u2022 core indicators, which includes the indicators from all the modules; and \u2022 data quality assurance tools, which countries can use to assess the quality of their routine health information system data. Part 2: Integrated health service analysis This part contains two modules, targeting general health service planners and managers at national level and district and facility levels respectively. The modules provide an integrated (or cross-cutting) approach to analysis of health service performance, drawing on indicators from multiple toolkit modules. Part 3: Programme-specific guidance This part contains programme-specific modules including: \u2022 reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health); \u2022 Expanded Programme on Immunization (Expanded Programme on Immunization); \u2022 human immunodeficiency virus (human immunodeficiency virus); \u2022 tuberculosis (tuberculosis); \u2022 malaria; and \u2022 hepatitis. Each of these modules contains a set of core indicators specific to the programme, addresses related data quality issues, presents recommended analyses and visualizations, and includes considerations for interpretation and use. The indicators and analyses presented in the guidance manuals can be applied using various software packages. Electronic configuration packages for the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) are included in the toolkit; each programme-specific module has an accompanying DHIS2 package. 1.2 Overview of routine health information systems As health workers go about their daily work of delivering care, they record data in health facility records such as individual patient records (e.g. antenatal cards), registers, tally sheets and log books. Selected data are extracted from these records, aggregated in tally sheets or counted from registers, and then consolidated in monthly paper-based report forms. The reports are submitted at regular intervals through the routine health information system to successive levels of the health system, with further aggregation, analysis and use at each level, e.g. district, province and national levels. Data reported through the routine health information system may be called \u201croutine health information system data\u201d, \u201croutine health facility data\u201d or simply \u201croutine data\u201d. A defining feature of routine health information system data is that they are reported regularly, usually at intervals of up to 1 year. In practice, this often refers to monthly or quarterly reports. However, less frequent reports are also sometimes considered part of the routine health information system, e.g. annual facility reports on infrastructure, staffing, etc. ",
                "3": "The routine health information system may be paper-based or electronic or a hybrid of both system-types. In most health systems, aggregate data from the monthly reports are entered into an electronic database. This data entry may occur at various levels of the system, e.g. health centre, district office, etc. In some routine health information system, aggregate data from all programmes are entered into the same electronic system; in other cases, specific programmes have separate systems. Data collected at community level (e.g. by community health workers) and reported to health facilities may also be included in the routine health information system, as well as data produced by other health service delivery sites such as prisons, schools and workplaces. 4 Some of these data from other sites may be aggregated with facility data. However, the facility and non-facility data should also be analysed and presented separately. This document refers specifically to the analysis of aggregated routine health information system data generated within health facilities. The routine health information system within the national health information system (health information system) The routine health information system is an integral part of the overall national health information system. health information system data sources are usually either population- based or institution-based. Population-based sources include population censuses, civil registration and vital statistics (civil registration and vital statistics) systems and population-based surveys. These sources relate to the entire population (i.e. not only to people using health facilities). Institution-based sources include the routine health information system, health facility surveys/assessments and data systems for health service resources (e.g. infrastructure information systems, logistics management information systems (logistics management information system), health workforce information systems, financial management information systems). Some types of data are obtained from both population-based and institution-based sources (\u201cmixed sources\u201d), e.g. surveillance data are obtained from community sources and other public health surveillance systems as well as from health facility reports. All data sources have inherent strengths and limitations. An essential function of the overall health information system is to match each data element/indicator with the most appropriate and efficient means for generating it. Some data can be generated from multiple sources. The type and maturity of the various health information system components, as well as the frequency at which the data are needed, should determine the most appropriate data source for a specific context. Regarding the routine health information system, these decisions have important implications for the workload of facility staff as well as for data quality. Advantages of routine health information system data The routine health information system is an established component of the health service delivery system, providing information on a wide range of services. It applies across the entire country, at all levels of the health system. routine health information system data are collected by and can be analysed by the service providers themselves, providing them with insights into the outputs and outcomes of their work. As routine health information system data are collected continuously and analysed regularly, they provide up-to-date information on health services and on health conditions occurring the populations using the services, thus facilitating early identification of problems and enabling managers to take timely actions. The routine health information system can be a data source for informing subnational planning and resource allocation. As the routine health information system supplies data representing subnational (e.g. district) and facility levels, it contributes to monitoring of geographic inequities and progress toward targets at these operational levels. 4 If these services are not included in the analysis of routine health information system data, populations such as school-age children and adolescents may be unaccounted for in the country health information system. ",
                "4": "Limitations of routine health information system data Health facility data can provide information only on the people that use the facilities. However, substantial parts of the population may not have access to the facilities (e.g. nomadic or marginalized groups) or may choose to use alternate care options (e.g. self-medication, traditional healers). Furthermore, some facilities (notably private providers) may not be included in the national routine health information system. Facility data are therefore not representative of the entire population, unless all facilities are included in the routine health information system; reporting rates are high; and facility utilization rates are higher than 95%, which is rarely the case. There are ongoing challenges in establishing reliable population estimates for use as denominators for rate and coverage indicators. Official population estimates are derived from census projections. However, significant demographic changes may have occurred since the last census and, over time, census projections may differ substantially from true population numbers. Furthermore, census estimates may not be available for small subnational areas such as districts. (Chapter 5 provides further discussion on population estimates.) Depending on the maturity level of the system, in some contexts the routine health information system may not be the most appropriate means of obtaining some types of data. For example, where the routine health information system is mainly paper based, the collection of detailed quality-of-care or outcome data adds a substantial workload to health workers already overstretched by clinical and reporting duties. This overburdening also risks contributing to the deterioration of data quality. Such data could be collected instead through periodic facility assessments, supervision visits, sentinel facilities or special studies, and used in conjunction with routine health information system data. Analysis of routine health information system data Data do not speak for themselves. Data analysis is the process of transforming data into information and evidence that can be used for decision-making and action. This process involves a cycle of several steps, all of which are equally important. The steps are summarized in Fig. 1.1. Fig. 1.1 Data analysis and use cycle The terms \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cinformation\u201d often are used interchangeably. However, \u201c data\u201d refers to raw, unprocessed numbers or text, while \u201c information\u201d refers to data that have been processed, organized and presented within a specific context to give the data meaning. Selection of appropriate indicators and the establishment of functional systems for data collection and reporting are the foundations that make data available for analysis. The data analysis process includes compilation, organization and review of the raw data, assessment of the data quality, making corrections DATA INFORMATION EVIDENCE DECISIONS Presentation Contextualization Interpretation Data organization Quality checks Indicator calculation Use Communication Indicator selection Data collection Reporting Action ",
                "5": "and adjustments where necessary (data \u201ccleaning\u201d) and then, through statistical calculations, transforming the data into indicators. The indicators can be presented in the form of visualizations (e.g. charts, tables and maps), along with information on the limitations of the data as well as relevant supplementary information and explanations. When the indicators are interpreted within the context of issues confronting the health system, the information (provided that it is of sufficient quality) becomes evidence . Evidence may be defined as \u201c\u2026 any form of knowledge, including, but not confined to research, of sufficient quality to inform decisions\u2026\u201d 5 Analysis of routine health information system data includes review of trends over time, assessment of performance against targets and benchmarks, comparisons among facilities or geographic/administrative units, and assessment of differences by age, sex or other types of disaggregation. Analysis also involves comparisons between interrelated services (e.g. tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus services) as well as review of routine health information system data in relation to data from other sources. Appropriate communication of information and evidence to decision-makers is critical. This includes formatting the information into dashboards, reports and presentations with user-friendly visuals, as well as providing explanations of the findings and interpretation within the specific context. Only then will the data have an opportunity to be used to inform decision-making that can result in actions. The steps of the data analysis and use cycle are described in the various sections of this document. 5 Buse K, Mays N, Walt G (2012).

The core routine health information system indicator list focuses data analysis on the most important indicators needed on a regular basis to monitor health services and inform decisions at various levels of the health system. Establishment of the core indicator list should be a collaborative process involving multiple programmes and stakeholders. The core indicator list should be reassessed periodically to ensure that it reflects current global standards and country priorities.

Assessment of facility representation in the routine health information system is different from assessment of reporting completeness, which measures whether the facilities that are already included in the routine health information system have submitted reports as required. National routine health information system data represent only those facilities that report into the routine health information system. In some countries all facilities are included, while in others only the ministry of health facilities are part of the system.

The Master Facility List includes the data needed to accurately identify each facility, such as facility name, unique facility identifier, location and contact information, as well as administrative data to categorize the facility, such as facility type, ownership and operational status. The Master Facility List may also include information about the service capacity of the facility, e.g. type of services offered and number of beds.

Such assessments involve a comprehensive review of a limited set of tracer indicators representing key programmes. This provides an overview of the general quality of routine health information system data and helps to identify problems that are common across multiple programmes. This information can be used to inform data quality improvement strategies. The assessment can be conducted as a desk review and/or a field investigation. A desk review involves carrying out quality checks on the aggregated data reported by each facility or administrative unit (e.g. district); these data are usually available electronically. The quality checks involve the use of standardized data quality metrics. If time and resources permit, a desk review should be complemented by a field investigation. A field investigation is a more extensive review based on assessment of a sample of districts and health facilities. It includes a \u201cdata verification exercise\u201d to determine the extent to which reported data match the data found in the facility\u2019s source documents (e.g. facility registers, tally sheets). The field investigation also includes an assessment of the facility\u2019s data management system to determine its adequacy in producing quality data. World Health Organization, with partners, has developed a Data quality assessment (DQA) toolkit 12 which contains guidance as well as data collection and analysis tools to support desk reviews and field investigations. The toolkit includes an Excel tool that analyses the data quality dimensions of completeness, internal consistency and external consistency. The toolkit also includes the World Health Organization Data Quality Tool, 13 an application that can be installed on the national DHIS2 system to automatically generate and display data quality metrics. Periodic in-depth programme-specific reviews In addition to the quality metrics of the DQA toolkit , the progamme-specific packages of the Toolkit for analysis and use of routine health facility data include discussions on data quality issues specifically relevant to the programme. Further information on in-depth programme-specific reviews can be found in relevant programme documents. 4.2 Dimensions of data quality assessment Four dimensions are considered in a basic data quality assessment: \u2022 reporting completeness and timeliness; \u2022 internal consistency of reported data; \u2022 external consistency with other data sources; and \u2022 external comparison of population data. The following section briefly describes the concepts underpinning each dimension. Refer to the data quality review toolkit for an in-depth discussion of the dimensions, the metrics for measuring each dimension and visualizations that display the findings of the data quality assessment. Dimension 1: Reporting completeness and timeliness Completeness is expressed as the percentage of expected 14 reports submitted to a higher level of the reporting system. Completeness is assessed at each reporting level, e.g. completeness of facility reports 12 https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/health-service-data 13 https://apps.dhis2.org/ 14 For example, 12-monthly reports are expected from each health facility per year. ",
                "10": "submitted to district level; completeness of district reports (aggregated data from multiple facilities) 15 submitted to provincial or national level. Key steps for assessing completeness include: \u25aa Assess completeness of reporting for each form Different reporting forms are often used to report different services. For example, outpatient morbidity is often reported separately from immunizations, antenatal care, etc. Completeness is assessed separately for each service or report. The expected number of reports may vary according to the service. For calculation of reporting completeness, the numerator is the number of reports received and the denominator is the number of facilities expected to submit each form. \u25aa Assess completeness of reporting for key data elements This step assesses the completeness of specific data elements within a reporting form. Each cell of a reporting form represents a data element. (Faced with the burden of completing many cells, health workers may consistently leave certain cells blank, using only a subset of cells for reporting.) \u25aa Consider completeness of reporting from hospitals and private sector facilities Hospitals report the great majority of admissions/discharges and inpatient deaths as well as a significant proportion of outpatient services. Yet in some health systems, reporting completeness is significantly lower from hospitals than from primary care facilities. There may be incomplete reporting from all hospitals or from only some large referral hospitals. Some hospitals may not report at all. This incompleteness can introduce an important bias in nationwide statistics on the services offered by such facilities, such as inpatient services, surgical services, deaths, diagnoses that require specialized services (e.g. cancers, heart diseases, neglected tropical diseases, etc.). As noted in Chapter 3, some or all private facilities may not be represented in the routine health information system. Among private facilities that are included, NGOs generally have good reporting rates, while reporting by private-for-profit facilities is often problematic. \u25aa Assess the impact of incomplete reporting on coverage Incomplete reporting and variations in completeness over time affect the interpretation of levels and trends in coverage and service utilization indicators. Analysis of routine health information system data should include an assessment of the impact of incomplete reporting on coverage indicators. Based on this assessment, analysts may consider adjusting the number of events reported in the routine health information system to obtain a more realistic picture of the levels and trends. Annex 1 provides further details on adjustment methods. Dimension 2: Internal consistency of reported data Internal consistency relates to the coherence between different routine health information system data elements that have an expected relationship with each other. Assessment of internal consistency examines whether data values follow expected patterns over time and in relation to each other. Data entry error is an important cause of inconsistency. Errors may occur, for example, when data are added up or transcribed from a tally sheet or register to a monthly report or transcribed or entered from a monthly paper report into an electronic database. Key steps for assessing internal consistency include: \u25aa Assess coherence between the same data items at different points in time Outliers are values that are unusually high or low in comparison with historical trends. Major data entry errors can be identified by screening for outliers; tables or charts showing trends over time can be used to quickly identify outlier values. Fig. 4.1 illustrates how the expected month-to-month stability in the number of maternal health and immunization services delivered can be used identify very large outliers (for example, the September 2019 value of bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (vaccine) doses) based upon nationwide total values. To identify smaller outliers, the same chart can be viewed at district level. Outliers often reflect poor data quality, but they can also be the result of true changes in events. 15 Where facility reports are entered into an online electronic data management system such as DHIS2, the aggregation is done automatically and no distinction can be made between facility-level reporting completeness and higher-level (district or province) reporting completeness. ",
                "11": "Fig. 4.1 Doses given for select vaccines, nationwide, last 12 months In general, values of more than three standard deviations higher or lower than expected may be considered data errors, unless there is evidence that the value is correct. For highly consistent data, narrower limits than three standard deviations (standard deviation) can be used to identify outliers. Seasonal data, such as the number of malaria cases, do not show the same month-to-month consistency as data on maternal health and immunization services. However, to identify outliers the seasonal trend for the last 12 months can be compared with the seasonal trend for 12 to 23 months previously, 24 to 35 months previously, etc. Year-to-year consistency can also be assessed. For example, the annual fluctuation in tuberculosis data is likely to be less than 10%; if it is greater than 10%, the data may reflect quality problems rather than true trends. Ideally, extreme outliers are identified and investigated at district level. Investigations may involve communications with facility staff or, for example, comparisons of doses administered with commodities supplied in specific facilities. At the national level, such investigations are often too time-consuming to be done at the time that an annual or multi-year report is prepared. Therefore, outliers identified at this level need to be corrected to obtain a \u201cclean\u201d dataset for further analysis. Analysts should consider replacement of the outlier by the expected value based on previous time periods. Any adjustments should be documented. \u25aa Assess coherence between related data items Data elements that have a predictable relationship are examined to check whether the expected relationship does in fact exist between them. For example, the number of children receiving the first dose of diphtheria\u2013tetanus\u2013pertussis vaccine (DTP1) is expected to be the roughly equal to the number of children receiving the first dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV1), as these vaccines are given at the same time. The number of DTP1 doses given is expected to be greater than (or equal to) the number of DTP3 doses given. If DTP1 minus DTP3 is negative, there is a \u201cnegative dropout\u201d. Negative dropout for a full year at the level of a district or higher is usually a sign of poor data quality. Similarly, the number of DTP1 doses should usually not be greater than the number of ANC1 visits, unless there is a special explanation, e.g. ANC1 may be under-reported because women attend non-reporting private clinics for antenatal care. \u25aa Assess consistency between reported data and source documents This is the only dimension of the data quality assessment that requires additional collection of primary data. It involves a field investigation to assess reporting accuracy through comparison of reported data with the same data in the source documents in health facilities. Source documents may include registers, tally sheets or individual patient records. This assessment (\u201cverification exercise\u201d) may provide evidence of over-reporting or under-reporting or it may reveal problems related to the aggregation of data. ",
                "12": "Assess other potential consistency issues An unusual degree of uniformity in the data or the existence of certain patterns may also point to quality issues. Performance that seems \u201ctoo perfect\u201d may be worth investigating. When achievements are linked to financial incentives, the possibility of \u201cover-reporting\u201d should be considered. Datasets should be reviewed for double entry of data for time periods (e.g. duplication of entries for 2 consecutive months) or reporting units (e.g. duplication of entries for different facilities). Data with very many reported values that are multiples of 5 or 10 may point to guesses rather than reporting of true values. The data should also be checked for unlikely or impossible entries, e.g. males on oral contraception, females with prostate cancer, pregnancies in females under 10 years of age. Dimension 3: External consistency with other data sources This dimension examines the level of agreement between two data sources that measure the same health indicator. Indicators derived from routine health information system data may be compared with indicators obtained through: \u2022 estimates from population-based surveys; \u2022 parallel data systems (e.g. vertical, programme-specific systems); \u2022 sentinel site data; and \u2022 statistics that have been officially reported to World Health Organization. The most important data sources for comparison with facility data are population-based surveys. Section 6.5 provides further details on such comparisons. Dimension 4: External comparison of population data This dimension examines the adequacy of the population data used to obtain denominators for calculating routine health information system indicators on rate and coverage. Different sources of population estimates (for which the values are calculated differently) are compared to assess the level of agreement between them. The greater the consistency between the estimates from different sources, the greater the likelihood that the values represent the true population value. If the population estimates from the different sources are very different, the coverage estimates based on the respective denominators can be very different for a given indicator, even though the programmatic output (numerator) is the same. Examples of population comparisons: \u2022 population projections of live births from the national bureau of statistics are compared with United Nations projections of live births for the country; \u2022 population projections from the national bureau of statistics are compared with population values used by programmes; \u2022 population projections of live births or surviving infants from the national bureau of statistics are compared with estimates derived from facility data on DTP1 vaccinations received. Population denominators are discussed in further detail in Chapter 5. ",

                "14": "Denominators, representing estimates of the target population, are required to calculate rates (e.g. disease incidence per 1000 population per year), coverage (e.g. percentage of infants vaccinated) and service utilization indicators (e.g. outpatient department attendance rates) from routine health information system data. However, reliable estimates of target populations remain an ongoing challenge in many settings. Denominators are usually derived from census-based projections, but alternate methods may also be considered. 5.1 Census-based projections Official population estimates are usually based on projections from the most recent national population census. However, censuses may contain inaccuracies, e.g. undercounting of some areas. Furthermore, the reliability of the projections declines as years since the census pass. The projections of the total population are based on population growth rates that were observed in the previous intercensal period (usually a decade). However, major changes may have taken place since the last census, including changes in fertility and mortality, migration into or out of the country, and changes in population distribution among subnational areas. Consequently, the census projections may be substantially different from the true population numbers, particularly for subnational areas. Furthermore, it is often difficult to use census projections to estimate appropriate denominators for individual districts and health facilities. In addition to the challenges previously described, census data may not include small area estimates, such as for districts or health facility catchment areas. Estimates of pregnancies, live births and surviving infants (the denominators for calculating coverage of maternal health and immunization services) are typically calculated by multiplying an estimate of the total population by an estimate of the \u201ccrude birth rate\u201d (crude birth rate: the estimated number of live births per year per 1000 persons in the total population). This may represent another source of inaccuracy, as the crude birth rate may have declined significantly since the last census and there may be large variations in the crude birth rate between regions and districts. When census projections are used to estimate denominators, coverage may be significantly greater than 100% in some districts, but very low in others. In some cases, such findings may be true, for example, people living in one district may use services in a neighbouring district, as is often the case in urban areas. However, a common cause of coverage greater than 100% is an underestimation of the target population that resulted from incorrect or outdated census projections. The opposite situation (coverage that is much lower than in reality) is probably also common but is more difficult to detect. Unexpected year-to-year changes in coverage and rates may occur when target population estimates are adjusted after new census data become available. The influence of such denominator adjustments can be illustrated by charting the numerators and the denominators by year, along with the coverage indicators. Countries should ensure that population estimates are retrospectively adjusted following a census in order to produce corrected time trends in coverage and rates. 5.2 Other methods Alternate methods are sometimes used to improve denominator estimates and coverage calculations, for example: Estimates derived from routine health information system data: routine health information system data on numbers of ANC1 or DTP1 are sometimes used to estimate the numbers of pregnant women or surviving infants in the population.

                "15": "can be used only when coverage is consistently very high (> 90%) for ANC1 or DTP1 (as confirmed by population-based surveys) and when the facility data are believed to be of high quality. This methodology is discussed further in Annex 3. Note: Some routine health information system indicators assess the percentage of individuals receiving a specific intervention among those that accessed the service. The denominator in such indicators is based on facility data rather than on population data, e.g. \u201cAntenatal syphilis screening (%)\u201d, where the denominator is the number of first antenatal care visits and the numerator is the number of antenatal care clients screened for syphilis. Health programme estimates: Some programmes may use target population estimates that differ from those of the national bureau of statistics. If programme denominators are used for the analysis of routine health information system data, the analysis reports should include a table of these denominators along with an explanation of the methods used to calculate them. Local enumeration: Local headcounts are sometimes used to estimate the target population size. This approach can provide good operational targets for health workers at local levels. However, local enumeration is not recommended for coverage monitoring at national level as it lacks independence. Furthermore, local counts may also be inaccurate as some groups (e.g. nomadic or remote populations) may not be included. Where reliable population estimates are not available, as is often the case for health facility catchment areas, presentation of numerator trends can provide useful information. Refer to Integrated health service analysis: district and facility levels for further discussion. Presenting denominator sources The methods and assumptions for projecting and estimating the target populations should always be presented along with the results of the analysis. A table of estimates of the key target populations (total population, pregnancies, surviving infants, children under 5 years of age, etc.) by administrative unit should be included in the analysis report. Where denominators are based on census projections, the annual growth rate should be stated. Table 5.1 provides an illustration.

                "16": "Basic statistical terms Table 6.1 Basic statistical terms Term Definition Rate A rate is the frequency with which an event or case occurs in a defined population over a specified period of time. A rate is often expressed as events per 1000 population per year. Some rates are expressed per 10 000 or per 100 000 population. All events or persons in the numerator are also included in the denominator. Ratio A ratio is a comparison of values, showing their size in relation to each other. It is calculated by dividing the first value by the second. The numerator is not contained in the denominator. Ratios are written in various ways, e.g. 3:4 or 3 to 4 or 0.75 or 75%. Proportion A proportion is the number of events or cases that occur in a defined population, expressed as a fraction, a decimal or a percentage. All events or persons in the numerator are also included in the denominator. Coverage Coverage is a measure of the extent to which the services provided cover the potential need for these services in a population. It is expressed as a percentage in which the numerator is the number of service units provided, multiplied by 100, and the denominator is the target population in need of the service. Mean The mean is the sum of all the values in a set divided by the number of values in the set. A single very large value in the set can result in a very high and unrepresentative mean. Median When values in a set are ranked from smallest to largest, the median is the value in the middle of the list, i.e. half of the values are greater than or equal to the median and the other half are less than or equal to it. When there is an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. When there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. A single very large value in the set will not affect the median. 6.2 Aggregated versus individual data A large proportion of routine health information system data is based on reporting of total counts (\u201caggregates\u201d) of single events or characteristics, e.g. number of outpatient department visits, number of confirmed malaria diagnoses. These data can be collected using tally sheets and reporting does not require follow up of individual patients over time. Some programmes (e.g. immunization, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus,) use tracking systems to record information on individual patients over time. Sometimes these tracking systems are electronic (e.g. electronic registers) and may be integrated with the routine health information system. Often, however, they are separate systems and only selected aggregate data are extracted and submitted to the routine health information system. For some programmes, it is very difficult (or impossible) to obtain coverage or outcome indicators from aggregated routine health information system data, e.g. family planning, human immunodeficiency virus and noncommunicable diseases care. These programmes involve long-term care that needs repeated visits over time.

In programmes that do not implement such a system, simplified indicators for aggregate reporting can be used, e.g. the number of new contraceptive users or the number of newly diagnosed cases of human immunodeficiency virus, hypertension, diabetes, etc. 6.3 Disaggregation Disaggregation of routine health information system data by, for example, age group, sex and geographic location is important for identifying differences in disease patterns and service utilization. In the routine health information system, however, multiple disaggregations often substantially increase the reporting workload, particularly in paper-based systems, and may have a negative impact on quality data. Therefore, the purposes for which specific disaggregated data will be used and the frequencies at which such analyses are needed, warrant careful consideration. If short-term variations are unlikely, routine facility reports may not be the most suitable means of obtaining detailed disaggregated data. Other data collection methods should be considered, for example, sentinel sites, periodic studies or population-based surveys. The following extract from Immunization: guidance for programme managers provides an illustration: \u201c\u2026Sometimes the administered doses are further disaggregated, for example, by sex of the child, or the strategy that was used to vaccinate it (i.e. fixed versus outreach), or whether or not the child lives within the catchment area of the health facility. These additional disaggregations are not recommended as there is scant evidence that reliable data disaggregated in these ways can be collected or meaningfully used. Moreover, the recording and reporting workload doubles every time a new level of disaggregation is introduced. Therefore, the decision to further disaggregate immunization data needs to be weighed carefully against the benefit of the use that will be given to the collected data. Those designing routine reporting forms should aim to limit the number of cells and rely upon findings from household surveys to more reliably answer many questions\u2026 \u201d 16 6.4 Equity analysis Equity analysis is fundamental to the monitoring of universal health coverage (universal health coverage). Equity refers to fairness or impartiality: treatment of people in different ways, according to their needs, to achieve equality in outcomes. routine health information system data can identify differences in disease patterns, service utilization, coverage and health outcomes according to geographic/administrative units, sex, age groups and other disaggregations. These differences may point to underlying inequities related to, for example, risk factors, health service access and quality of care. Analysis of health service resource data in relation to, for example, service outputs and the population served, can highlight inequities in resource allocation. Subnational analysis (or \u201carea-based analysis\u201d) is the most important equity dimension that can be assessed using routine health information system data. As interventions to reduce inequity are implemented at subnational levels, routine health information system data can play an important role in informing resource allocation and planning. However, some caution is also needed when interpreting subnational data with an equity lens. For example, population density, land area and physical terrain should be considered when comparing service utilization among geographic areas. Furthermore, the population in one subnational area may choose to use the services in a neighbouring area. 16 Immunization: guidance for programme managers. Section 4. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2020. ",
                "18": "Analysis of health issues by socioeconomic characteristics is an essential aspect of equity assessment. However, socioeconomic data are not usually collected in the routine health information system, as recording and reporting are time consuming and the analysis would still need a population-based component to assess health service coverage among, for example, the poor. Population-based household surveys remain one of the best sources of data for analysis by socioeconomic status. 6.5 Comparisons with other data sources The synthesis and analysis of data from multiple sources and reconciliation of indicator values are essential to maximizing the value of all sources of data. Comparisons with data from other sources can provide insights into the quality of routine health information system data. Such comparisons can also provide insights into the extent to which the routine health information system data are representative of the population and are suitable for use in overall programme and health sector performance assessment. It is good practice to use tables and charts to present routine health information system data alongside data from other sources. \u25aa Population-based surveys Population-based surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys or the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, are the most important sources for comparison with routine health information system data. Estimates from population-based surveys are often cited as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for measurement of coverage as they provide representative information on the entire population, including the people that do not use health services. However, surveys also have limitations, including: \u2022 time lag: there may be a period of several years between the time that an event occurred and the availability of the survey results; \u2022 limited geographic disaggregation: survey sample sizes are rarely large enough to provide valid estimates for lower subnational levels such as districts; \u2022 quality problems: surveys vary in their adherence to sampling and interview protocols and other quality standards; all surveys contain sampling errors, which increase at subnational levels due to small sample sizes ; 17 non-sampling errors may also occur, e.g. selection bias or recall bias. 18 \u25aa Health facility assessments Health facility assessments/surveys are used to collect data not usually reported through the routine health information system, such as data on quality-of-care and availability of equipment, medicines and human resources. Facility assessments can also be used to verify routine health information system data. (Refer to Section 4.1 for further discussion on data verification.) \u25aa Parallel data systems A key objective in the development of routine health information system standards is the reduction of duplication and redundancy in data collection. Unfortunately, however, the existence of parallel data systems that report on the same health events remains common. For example, in some countries the Expanded Programme on Immunization (Expanded Programme on Immunization) collects immunization data both on an Expanded Programme on Immunization form and on a separate child health form. Such parallel systems increase the reporting workload and can result in confusion if there are discrepancies between the data reported by the two systems. It is important to review and analyse the data from each of the parallel systems and to present the findings as part of the analysis. Possible reasons for discrepancies should be discussed. Each table or chart must specify which of the parallel systems was used for the analysis presented. 17 Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys reports include annexes that provide confidence intervals for key indicators at national and regional levels. Confidence intervals estimate the effect of sampling error. 18 For example, recall bias may occur if vaccination cards were reviewed for fewer than half of the children surveyed and the survey relied on caregiver memory of vaccinations received.

Such sites often have the capacity to assure a higher quality of diagnosis and reporting than other facilities. Demographic surveillance sites that regularly track household demographics and health status in defined areas can also provide reliable data on the population and health events. \u25aa Data triangulation \u201cTriangulation\u201d of findings from multiple data sources and methods, including the routine health information system, can be used to obtain the most valid estimate for an indicator.

                "21": "Charts Charts can show a large quantity of data in a way that is quick and easy to understand. The shape of the chart helps the user to see trends over time, find patterns, see the relationships between variables and identify potential data quality problems. 21 Different types of charts are used for different purposes. \u25aa Line charts Line charts are used for showing time series of data and for identifying trends. A trend is a pattern of gradual change or a general direction, e.g. upward or downward, shown by a series of data values over time. A minimum of three time periods should be presented when analysing trends. Fig. 7.1 illustrates seasonal trends in malaria cases based on rapid diagnostic testing (rapid diagnostic test (malaria)). Note the peak from May to July of each year. Trend analysis can enable prediction of the pattern of the data in the future and can also quickly identify outliers or unusual fluctuations. Line charts can also be used to show the relationships between different data elements over time. For example, Fig. 7.2 shows that the numbers of DTP1 doses administered have consistently been higher than the numbers of DTP3 doses administered. Fig. 7.1 rapid diagnostic test (malaria) positive malaria cases, region X, 2017\u20132019 Fig. 7.2 Vaccine doses given, district Y, 2019 \u25aa Column and bar charts Column (vertical) or bar (horizontal) charts are used to show comparisons, e.g. among different geographic areas or among different data elements or indicators. The columns or bars should be ordered by size (ranked), unless these are reasons for different arrangements. Such ranked charts are also called \u201cleague tables\u201d. Bar charts can be used to avoid clutter when data labels are long or when there many items to compare.

Fig. 7.6 Deliveries in facilities by provider, region A, 2016 However, when pie charts contain more than about five segments, they may be difficult to understand quickly. In general, bar charts are preferred. For example, pie charts are sometimes used to display proportionate morbidity or mortality data (e.g. \u201ctop 10\u201d causes of death or death), but a bar or column chart is a better choice, as illustrated in Figs 7.7 and 7.8.

In addition, the size or colour of points placed on a map can represent the value of a key indicator. However, maps can also mask the underlying data and should be displayed in conjunction with the numbers they represent as well as any potential limitations. Fig. 7.9 is an example of a thematic map.

                "24": "Presenting a story The presentation of data as a \u201cstory\u201d helps the reader to engage with various aspects of the situation illustrated by the data. This may involve, for example, the presentation of several charts showing trends of related indicators such as tuberculosis notifications, the percentage of tuberculosis cases tested for human immunodeficiency virus, and the tuberculosis treatment success rate. It may also involve displaying together indicators from different programmes to provide an overall picture of the health situation. Various tools and approach may be used to create data stories. \u25aa Websites and dashboards Computer or web-based data management systems can be used to display multiple tables, charts and maps on the same page. This is called a dashboard. The intention is that the \u201cdriver\u201d (the user/reader) can glance at this dashboard to gain a quick impression of the performance of key indicators. Dashboards can be customized to the needs of the user. For routine health information system data, the visualizations in the dashboard are linked to the raw data. The dashboard is continuously updated as new data are entered, providing a \u201cclose to real-time\u201d snapshot of performance. Fig. 7.10 provides an example of a dashboard in DHIS2. Fig. 7.10 DHIS2 dashboard showing fictitious data for Sierra Leone \u25aa Summary measures Analysts sometimes combine several indicators to create a summary measure or index. A small set of standard indicators representing a range of health service functions can be selected to provide an assessment of the overall performance of a national or subnational health system. The scores from this fixed set of indicators are combined mathematically (e.g. by averaging the coverage achieved with various services or by assigning scores to percentage categories). This generates an index that can be used for assessing year-to-year trends or for creating a \u201cleague table\u201d that ranks subnational units. ",
                "25": "It is important to note that while an index may serve as a useful measure for comparison, it is strongly influenced by the selection and weighting of the indicators within the calculation, and by the limitations of each indicator. The index should therefore always be assessed in conjunction with its component indicators. In the example presented in Fig. 7.11, each indicator value is assigned a score of 1, 0 or -1 according to defined levels of performance. The different colours indicate whether an indicator is on track, in process or not on track, in each region. This enables quick identification of underperforming geographic areas as well as underperforming interventions. The \u201cScore\u201d column provides the overall performance index. The regions are ranked according to the values in this column. Fig. 7.11 Regional league table, Ghana Source: Holistic assessment of the health sector programme of work 2012. Ministry of Health, Ghana; June 2013. iMMR: institutional maternal mortality ratio; OPD: outpatient department (visits). League tables can be presented as tables or charts and can be used to display a single indicator or an index. While a target or benchmark may be included where relevant, league tables are often used to display data for which there are no established benchmarks. In such cases, the highlighting of higher  and lower performing areas can provide the basis for further investigation into the reasons for the differences and the identification of best practices as well as problems. However, such comparisons may also be viewed as unfair because of underlying differences between the units that may influence the ranking, e.g. there may be substantial socioeconomic differences. Stratified (grouped) rankings may be useful, especially if large differences exist within the country. For example, districts can be grouped according to urban, peri-urban or rural character of the district, or epidemiological characteristics (e.g. with and without malaria; human immunodeficiency virus prevalence). Districts can also be classified into socioeconomic quintiles, according to an official classification from the national bureau of statistics. \u25aa Ten tips for presenting routine health information system data 1. On the cover page of a report, always specify the month and year in which the document was finalized. 2. Every table, chart and map must have a title and data labels. 3. Specify the time period and the geographic/administrative area for which the statistics apply. 4. Specify the data source \u2013 not only the publication or the organization that provided the data but also the data source itself. 5. Present and discuss notable findings about the data quality for every table, chart and map. 6. Explain the methods used for estimating denominators and include a table of key denominators. \u201cIn the regional analysis of \u2026 2011, three regions came out with a score of zero or below. In the current review all regions have a positive score, which indicates a relative improvement over 2011 for these selected service delivery indicators.\u201d ",
                "26": "When presenting charts showing coverage, also present recent survey estimates of the same indicator and, where possible, show the confidence interval for the survey estimates. 8. For each table, chart or map in the report, include a narrative that interprets the most important findings and discusses indicator definitions and any special limitations. 9. If a table extends over more than one page of a report, always print the headers at the top of each column on each page of the report. 10. If findings are to be projected on a screen (e.g. PowerPoint presentation) do not include any text or numbers of a font size smaller than 16 point. ",

In a routine health information system, there are usually processes (e.g. standard operating procedures) in place for data collection and reporting, and sometimes also for data analysis. However, a systematic approach to data interpretation is often lacking. There is no standard approach to interpretation, but the process of understanding the data can be guided by applying six questions: what, where, when, who, how and why? These questions can be applied both to the health/disease context as well as to health services performance. Table 8.1 provides examples of uses of the epidemiological questions.

                "1": "Dedicate Resources to Infection Prevention (Administrative Resources) Infection prevention must be made a priority in any setting where healthcare is delivered.  Those with primary administrative oversight of the outpatient facility must ensure that sufficient fiscal and human resources are available to develop and maintain infection prevention and occupational health programs.  This includes the availability of sufficient and appropriate equipment and supplies necessary for the consistent observation of Standard Precautions, including hand hygiene products, injection equipment, and personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, face and eye protection). Infection prevention programs must extend beyond Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) bloodborne pathogens training to address patient protection.  Facilities should assure that at least one individual with training in infection prevention is employed by or regularly available (e.g., by contract) to manage the facility\u2019s infection prevention program. This individual should be involved in the development of written infection prevention policies and have regular communication with HCP to address specific issues or concerns related to infection prevention. The development and ongoing refinement of infection prevention policies and procedures should be based on evidence-based guidelines, regulations, or standards.  These policies and procedures should be tailored to the facility and re-assessed on a regular basis (e.g., annually), taking into consideration the types of services provided by the facility and the patient population that is served. This process (referred to as risk assessment by the Infection Prevention profession) will allow facilities to better prioritize resources and focus extra attention on those areas that are determined to pose greater risk to their patients.  For example, an ambulatory surgical center, which performs on-site sterilization of reusable surgical devices, would be expected to have more detailed policies regarding device reprocessing than a primary care office, where on-site sterilization is less likely to be performed.  However, both facilities should have policies and procedures addressing handling of reusable medical devices.  Similarly, a clinic primarily serving patients infected with tuberculosis will have infection prevention needs beyond those of a general pediatric office. Facility administrators should also assure that facility policies and procedures address occupational health needs including vaccination of HCP, management of exposures or infections in personnel requiring post-exposure prophylaxis and/or work restrictions, and compliance with the OSHA bloodborne pathogens standard. Recommendations for prevention of infections in HCP can be found in the following resources: Guideline for infection control in healthcare personnel (available at: http:// www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/InfectControl98. pdf ), Recommended Vaccines for Healthcare Workers (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html ), and OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens and Needlestick Prevention (available at: http://www.osha.gov/ SLTC/bloodbornepathogens/index.html",

Assure at least one individual with training in infection prevention is employed by or regularly available (e.g., by contract) to manage the facility\u2019s infection prevention program. 4. Develop written infection prevention policies and procedures appropriate for the services provided by the facility and based upon evidence-based guidelines, regulations, or standards. Educate and Train Healthcare Personnel Ongoing education and competency-based training of HCP are critical for ensuring that infection prevention policies and procedures are understood and followed.  Education on the basic principles and practices for preventing the spread of infections should be provided to all HCP.  Training should include both HCP safety (e.g., OSHA bloodborne pathogens training) and patient safety, emphasizing job- or task- specific needs.  Training should be provided upon orientation to the facility and, to maintain competency, should be repeated annually and anytime policies or procedures are updated/ revised. Competencies should be documented following each training. Key recommendations for education and training of healthcare personnel in outpatient settings: 1. Provide job- or task-specific infection prevention education and training to all HCP. a. This includes those employed by outside agencies and available by contract or on a volunteer basis to the facility. 2. Training should focus on principles of both HCP safety and patient safety. 3. Training should be provided upon hire and repeated annually and when policies or procedures are updated/revised. 4. Competencies should be documented following each training. Monitor and Report Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance is defined as the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data regarding a health-related event for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve health. Surveillance typically refers to tracking of outcome measures (e.g., HAIs) but can also refer to tracking of adherence to specific process measures (e.g., hand hygiene, environmental cleaning) as a means to reduce infection transmission. Surveillance for outcome measures in outpatient settings is challenging because patient encounters may be brief or sporadic and evaluation and treatment of consequent infections may involve different healthcare settings (e.g., hospitals).  To assist with identification of infections that may be related to care provided by the facility, patients should be educated regarding signs and symptoms of infection and instructed to notify the facility if such signs or symptoms occur. ",
                "3": "At a minimum, outpatient facilities need to adhere to local, state, and federal requirements regarding reportable disease and outbreak reporting.  Certain types of facilities (e.g., ambulatory surgical centers) may also be subject to additional HAI surveillance or process measure reporting requirements, for example as part of accreditation, Medicare certification, or state/local statutes. Facilities should check the requirements for their state/region to assure that they are compliant with all regulations and should have contact information for their local and/or state health department available to ensure required reporting is done in a timely manner.  (A list of state reportable disease websites is available at: http://www.cste.org/?StateReportable ). Regular focused practice surveys or audits (e.g., audits of infection prevention practices including hand hygiene, medication handling, reprocessing of reusable devices) offer a means to ensure ongoing compliance of HCP with recommended practices. One example of an audit tool being used by federal surveyors to assess infection control in ambulatory surgical centers is available at: http://www.cms.gov/manuals/downloads/ som107_exhibit_351.pdf .  Another tool is the Infection Prevention Checklist for Outpatient Settings (Appendix A), a companion to this guide. Key recommendations for HAI surveillance and reporting in outpatient settings: 1. Educate patients who have undergone procedures at the facility regarding signs and symptoms of infection that may be associated with the procedure and instruct them to notify the facility if such signs and symptoms occur. 2. Adhere to local, state and federal requirements regarding HAI surveillance, reportable diseases, and outbreak reporting. 3. Perform regular audits of HCP adherence to infection prevention practices. Adhere to Standard Precautions Standard Precautions are the minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status of the patient, in any setting where healthcare is delivered.  These practices are designed to both protect HCP and prevent HCP from spreading infections among patients. Standard Precautions include:  1) hand hygiene, 2) use of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, masks), 3) safe injection practices, 4) safe handling of potentially contaminated equipment or surfaces in the patient environment, and 5) respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.  Each of these elements of Standard Precautions are described in the sections that follow. Education and training on the principles and rationale for recommended practices are critical elements of Standard Precautions because they facilitate appropriate decision-making and promote adherence.  Further, at the facility level, an understanding of the specific procedures performed and typical patient interactions, as described above in Administrative Measures as part of policy and procedure development, will assure that necessary equipment is available. The application of Standard Precautions and guidance on appropriate selection and an example of donning and removal of personal protective equipment is described in detail in the 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/ Isolation2007.pdf ). Hand Hygiene Good hand hygiene, including use of alcohol- based hand rubs (ABHR) and handwashing with soap and water, is critical to reduce the risk of spreading infections in outpatient settings.  Use of ABHR as the primary mode of hand hygiene in healthcare settings is recommended by the CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) ",
                "4": "because of its activity against a broad spectrum of epidemiologically important pathogens, and because compared with soap and water, use of ABHR in healthcare settings can increase compliance with recommended hand hygiene practices by requiring less time, irritating hands less, and facilitating hand hygiene at the patient bedside. For these reasons, ABHR is the preferred method for hand hygiene in most clinical situations. Soap and water should be used when hands are visibly soiled (e.g., blood, body fluids) and is also preferred after caring for a patient with known or suspected Clostridium difficile or norovirus during an outbreak. Complete guidance on how and when hand hygiene should be performed, including recommendations regarding surgical hand antisepsis and artificial nails can be found in the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ PDF/rr/rr5116.pdf ). Key recommendations for hand hygiene in outpatient settings: 1. Key situations where hand hygiene should be performed include: a. Before contact with a patient. b. Before performing an aseptic task (e.g., insertion of IV, preparing an injection). c. After contact with the patient or objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient. d. After contact with blood, body fluids or contaminated surfaces. e. If hands will be moving from a contaminated-body site to a clean- body site during patient care. f. After removal of personal protective equipment (PPE). 2. Use soap and water when hands are visibly soiled (e.g., blood, body fluids), or after caring for patients with known or suspected Clostridium difficile or norovirus during an outbreak. Otherwise, the preferred method of hand hygiene in clinical situations is with an alcohol-based hand rub. Personal Protective Equipment Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) refers to wearable equipment that is intended to protect HCP from exposure to or contact with infectious agents.  Examples include gloves, gowns, face masks, respirators, goggles and face shields. The selection of PPE is based on the nature of the patient interaction and potential for exposure to blood, body fluids or infectious agents.  Examples of appropriate use of PPE for adherence to Standard Precautions include:  use of gloves in situations involving possible contact with blood or body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin or potentially infectious material; use of a gown to protect skin and clothing during procedures or activities where contact with blood or body fluids is anticipated; use of mouth, nose and eye protection during procedures that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood or other body fluids.  Hand hygiene is always the final step after removing and disposing of PPE. Each outpatient facility should evaluate the services they provide to determine specific needs and to assure that sufficient and appropriate PPE is available for adherence to Standard Precautions. All HCP at the facility should be educated regarding proper selection and use of PPE. Complete guidance on the appropriate selection of PPE, including one approach for donning and removing PPE is provided in the 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions (available at: http://www. cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf",
                "5": "recommendations for use of PPE in outpatient settings: 1. Facilities should assure that sufficient and appropriate PPE is available and readily accessible to HCP. 2. Educate all HCP on proper selection and use of PPE. a. PPE, other than respirators, should be removed and discarded prior to leaving the patient\u2019s room or care area.  If a respirator is used, it should be removed and discarded (or reprocessed if reusable) after leaving the patient room or care area and closing the door. b. Hand hygiene should be performed immediately after removal of PPE. 3. Wear gloves for potential contact with blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, non-intact skin or contaminated equipment. a. Do not wear the same pair of gloves for the care of more than one patient. b. Do not wash gloves for the purpose of reuse. 4. Wear a gown to protect skin and clothing during procedures or activities where contact with blood or body fluids is anticipated. a. Do not wear the same gown for the care of more than one patient. 5. Wear mouth, nose and eye protection during procedures that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood or other body fluids. Injection Safety Injection safety includes practices intended to prevent transmission of infectious diseases between one patient and another, or between a patient and healthcare provider during preparation and administration of parenteral medications. Implementation of the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard has helped increase the protection of HCP from blood exposure and sharps injuries, but there is room for improvement in outpatient settings.  For example, efforts to increase uptake of hepatitis B vaccination and implementation of safety devices that are designed to decrease risks of sharps injury are needed. Further attention to patient protection is also needed as evidenced by continued outbreaks in outpatient settings resulting from unsafe injection practices.  Unsafe practices that have led to patient harm include 1) use of a single syringe, with or without the same needle, to administer medication to multiple patients, 2) reinsertion of a used syringe, with or without the same needle, into a medication vial or solution container (e.g., saline bag) to obtain additional medication for a single patient and then using that vial or solution container for subsequent patients, 3) preparation of medications in close proximity to contaminated supplies or equipment and, 4) failure to wear a facemask (e.g., surgical mask) when placing a catheter or injecting material into the epidural or subdural space (e.g., during myelogram, epidural or spinal anesthesia). Guidance on safe injection practices can be found in the 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/ isolation/Isolation2007.pdf ).  Additional materials, including a list of frequently asked questions from providers and a patient notification toolkit, are also available ( http://www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety/ ). The One & Only Campaign is a public health effort to eliminate unsafe medical injections. ",
                "6": "The Campaign is led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Safe Injection Practices Coalition (SIPC).  To learn more about safe injection practices, and access training videos and other educational resources, please visit OneandOnlyCampaign.org Key recommendations for safe injection practices in outpatient settings: 1. Use aseptic technique when preparing and administering medications. 2. Cleanse the access diaphragms of medication vials with alcohol before inserting a device into the vial. 3. Never administer medications from the same syringe to multiple patients, even if the needle is changed or the injection is administered through an intervening length of intravenous tubing. 4. Do not reuse a syringe to enter a medication vial or container. 5. Do not administer medications from single-dose or single-use vials, ampoules, or bags or bottles of intravenous solution to more than one patient. 6. Do not use fluid infusion or administration sets (e.g., intravenous tubing) for more than one patient. 7. Dedicate multidose vials to a single patient whenever possible.  If multidose vials will be used for more than one patient, they should be restricted to a centralized medication area and should not enter the immediate patient treatment area (e.g., operating room, patient room/cubicle). 8. Dispose of used sharps at the point of use in a sharps container that is closable, puncture-resistant, and leak-proof. 9. Wear a facemask (e.g., surgical mask) when placing a catheter or injecting material into the epidural or subdural space (e.g., during myelogram, epidural or spinal anesthesia). Environmental Cleaning Outpatient facilities should establish policies and procedures for routine cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces as part of their infection prevention plan. Cleaning refers to the removal of visible soil and organic contamination from a device or environmental surface using the physical action of scrubbing with a surfactant or detergent and water, or an energy-based process (e.g., ultrasonic cleaners) with appropriate chemical agents.  This process removes large numbers of microorganisms from surfaces and must always precede disinfection. Disinfection is generally a less lethal process of microbial inactivation (compared to sterilization) that eliminates virtually all recognized pathogenic microorganisms but not necessarily all microbial forms (e.g., bacterial spores). Emphasis for cleaning and disinfection should be placed on surfaces that are most likely to become contaminated with pathogens, including those in close proximity to the patient (e.g., bedrails) and frequently-touched surfaces in the patient-care environment (e.g., doorknobs).  Facility policies and procedures should also address prompt and appropriate cleaning and decontamination of spills of blood or other potentially infectious materials. Responsibility for routine cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces should be assigned to appropriately trained HCP.  Cleaning procedures should be periodically monitored or assessed to ensure that they are consistently and correctly performed.  EPA-registered disinfectants or detergents/disinfectants with label claims for use in healthcare should be selected for disinfection. Disinfectant products should not be used as cleaners unless the label indicates the product is suitable for such use.  Healthcare professionals should follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for use of products selected for cleaning and disinfection (e.g., amount, dilution, contact time, safe use, and disposal",
                "7": "Complete guidance for the cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces, including for cleaning blood or body substance spills, is available in the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/ guidelines/eic_in_HCF_03.pdf ) and the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/ pdf/guidelines/Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf ). Key recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in outpatient settings: 1. Establish policies and procedures for routine cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in the facility. a. Policies and procedures should also address prompt and appropriate cleaning and decontamination of spills of blood or other potentially infectious materials. 2. Select EPA-registered disinfectants or detergents/disinfectants with label claims for use in healthcare. 3. Follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for use of cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants (e.g., amount, dilution, contact time, safe use, and disposal). Medical Devices Medical devices are labeled by the manufacturer as either reusable or single-use.  Reusable medical devices (e.g., endoscopes) should be accompanied by instructions for cleaning and disinfection or sterilization as appropriate.  Single-use devices (SUDs) are labeled by the manufacturer for only a single use and do not have reprocessing instructions.  They may not be reprocessed except by entities which have complied with FDA regulatory requirements and have received FDA clearance to reprocess specific SUDs as outlined in FDA Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff (available at: http://www.fda.gov/ MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ GuidanceDocuments/ucm071434 ).  Legally marketed SUDs are available from FDA-registered Third Party Reprocessors. All reusable medical devices must be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to prevent patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents.  The Spaulding Classification is a traditional approach that has been used to determine the level of disinfection or sterilization required for reusable medical devices, based upon the degree of risk for transmitting infections if the device is contaminated at the time of use. \u2751 \u2751 Critical items (e.g., surgical instruments) are objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system and must be sterile prior to use. \u2751 \u2751 Semi-critical items (e.g., endoscopes used for upper endoscopy and colonoscopy) contact mucous membranes or non-intact skin and require, at a minimum, high-level disinfection prior to reuse. \u2751 \u2751 Noncritical items (e.g., blood pressure cuffs) are those that may come in contact with intact skin but not mucous membranes and should undergo low- or intermediate-level disinfection depending on the nature and degree of contamination. \u2751 \u2751 Environmental surfaces (e.g., floors, walls) are those that generally do not contact the patient during delivery of care.  Cleaning may be all that is needed for the management of these surfaces but if disinfection is indicated, low-level disinfection is appropriate. ",
                "8": "Cleaning to remove organic material must always precede disinfection or sterilization because residual debris reduces the effectiveness of the disinfection and sterilization processes. Facilities should establish policies and procedures for containing, transporting, and handling devices that may be contaminated with blood or body fluids. Manufacturer\u2019s instructions for reprocessing any reusable medical device in the facility (including point-of-care devices such as blood glucose meters) should be readily available and used to establish clear and appropriate policies and procedures. Instructions should be posted at the site where device reprocessing is performed. Responsibility for cleaning and disinfection or sterilization of medical devices should be assigned to HCP with training in the required reprocessing steps and in the appropriate use of PPE necessary for handling of contaminated devices. Competencies of HCP responsible for reprocessing of devices should be documented initially upon assignment of those duties, annually, and whenever new devices are introduced or policies/procedures change. Recommendations for the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of medical devices, including general guidance on endoscope reprocessing are available in the Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/ Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf ).  Materials specific for the handling of blood glucose monitoring devices are also available.

Key recommendations for cleaning and disinfection or sterilization of medical devices in outpatient settings: 1. Facilities should ensure that reusable medical devices (e.g., blood glucose meters and other point-of-care devices, surgical instruments, endoscopes) are cleaned and reprocessed appropriately prior to use on another patient. 2. Reusable medical devices must be cleaned and reprocessed (disinfection or sterilization) and maintained according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  If the manufacturer does not provide such instructions, the device may not be suitable for multi-patient use. 3. Assign responsibilities for reprocessing of medical devices to HCP with appropriate training. a. Maintain copies of the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for reprocessing of devices in use at the facility; post instructions at locations where reprocessing is performed. b. Hands-on training on proper selection and use of PPE and recommended steps for reprocessing assigned devices should be provided upon hire (prior to being allowed to reprocess devices), annually, and when new devices are introduced or policies/procedures change. i. HCP should be required to demonstrate competency with reprocessing procedures (i.e., correct technique is observed by trainer) following each training. 4. Assure HCP have access to and wear appropriate PPE when handling and reprocessing contaminated medical devices. ",
                "9": "Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette is an element of Standard Precautions that highlights the need for prompt implementation of infection prevention measures at the first point of encounter with the facility (e.g., reception and triage areas). This strategy is targeted primarily at patients and accompanying family members or friends with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections, and applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering the facility. Additional information related to respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette can be found in the 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/ Isolation2007.pdf ). Recommendations for preventing the spread of influenza are available at: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/ infectioncontrol/ . Key recommendations for Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette in outpatient settings: 1. Implement measures to contain respiratory secretions in patients and accompanying individuals who have signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection, beginning at point of entry to the facility and continuing throughout the duration of the visit. a. Post signs at entrances with instructions to patients with symptoms of respiratory infection to: i. Inform HCP of symptoms of a respiratory infection when they first register for care, ii. Cover their mouths/noses when coughing or sneezing, iii. Use and dispose of tissues, iv. Perform hand hygiene after hands have been in contact with respiratory secretions. b. Provide tissues and no-touch receptacles for disposal of tissues. c. Provide resources for performing hand hygiene in or near waiting areas. d. Offer masks to coughing patients and other symptomatic persons upon entry to the facility, at a minimum, during periods of increased respiratory infection activity in the community. e. Provide space and encourage persons with symptoms of respiratory infections to sit as far away from others as possible.  If available, facilities may wish to place these patients in a separate area while waiting for care. 2. Educate HCP on the importance of infection prevention measures to contain respiratory secretions to prevent the spread of respiratory pathogens. Considerations Related to Transmission-based Precautions The majority of outpatient settings are not designed to implement all of the isolation practices and other Transmission-Based Precautions (e.g., Airborne Precautions for patients with suspected tuberculosis, measles or chicken pox) that are recommended for hospital settings. Nonetheless, specific syndromes involving diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., diarrhea, febrile respiratory illness, febrile rash) are routinely encountered in outpatient settings and deserve appropriate triage.  Facilities should develop and implement systems for early detection and management of potentially infectious patients at initial points of entry to the facility.  To the extent possible, this includes prompt placement of such patients into a single-patient room and a ",

Recommendations regarding management of multidrug-resistant organisms can be found in the Guideline for the Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms in Healthcare Settings, 2006 (available at: http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/ MDROGuideline2006.pdf ) Risk Assessment Facilities are encouraged to use the Infection Prevention Checklist for Outpatient Settings (Appendix A), a companion to the summary guide, to periodically assess practices in their facility and ensure they are meeting the minimum expectations for safe care.  In the course of auditing practices, facilities may identify lapses in infection control.  If such lapses are identified, efforts should be made to correct the practices, appropriately educate HCP (if applicable), and determine why the correct practice was not being performed.  In addition, consideration should also be made for determining the risk posed to patients by the deficient practices.  Certain infection control lapses (e.g., reuse of syringes on more than one patient or to access a medication container that is used for subsequent patients; reuse of lancets) have resulted in bloodborne pathogen transmission and should be halted immediately.  Identification of such lapses warrants immediate consultation with the state or local health department and appropriate notification and testing of potentially affected patients.  Additional resources describing approaches to evaluation and management of infection control breaches identified in healthcare settings, including those involving lapses related to reprocessing of medical devices, can be found in CDC\u2019s Steps for Evaluating and Infection Control Breach (available at: http://www.cdc. gov/hai/outbreaks/steps_for_eval_IC_breach. html ).  In addition, for circumstances warranting patient notification, CDC has developed a Patient Notification Toolkit (available at: http://www. cdc.gov/injectionsafety/pntoolkit/index.html) to assist healthcare facilities with conducting a patient notification. Conclusions The recommendations described in the preceding document represent the absolute minimum infection prevention expectations for safe care in outpatient (ambulatory care) settings.  This guidance is not all-encompassing.

Salt, sodium and potassium Most people consume too much sodium through salt (corresponding to an average of 9\u201312 g of salt per day) and not enough potassium. High salt consumption and insufficient potassium intake (less than 3.5 g) contribute to high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke ( 6,10 ). 1.7 million deaths could be prevented each year if people\u2019s salt consumption were reduced to the recommended level of less than 5 g per day ( 11 ). People are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, most salt comes from processed foods (e.g. ready meals; processed meats like bacon, ham and salami; cheese and salty snacks) or from food consumed frequently in large amounts (e.g. bread). Salt is also added to food during cooking (e.g. bouillon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the table (e.g. table salt). You can reduce salt consumption by: \u2022\tnot adding salt, soy sauce or fish sauce during the preparation of food \u2022\tnot having salt on the table \u2022\tlimiting the consumption of salty snacks \u2022\tchoosing products with lower sodium content. Some food manufacturers are reformulating recipes to reduce the salt content of their products, and it is helpful to check food labels to see how much sodium is in a product before purchasing or consuming it. Potassium, which can mitigate the negative effects of elevated sodium consumption on blood pressure, can be increased through consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. Sugars The intake of free sugars should be reduced throughout the lifecourse ( 5 ). Evidence indicates that in both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake ( 2,5 ), and that a reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake provides additional health benefits ( 5 ). Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Consuming free sugars increases the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity.

                "1": "an infection prevention and control programme with a dedicated, trained team should be in place in each acute health care facility for the purpose of preventing health care-associated infection and combating antimicrobial resistance through infection prevention and control good practices. (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) Rationale for the recommendation \u2022 Evaluation of the evidence from two studies shows that infection prevention and control programmes including dedicated, trained professionals are effective in reducing health care-associated infection in acute care facilities. However, due to the different methodologies and the different outcomes measured, no meta-analysis was performed. Furthermore, the Guidelines Development Group noted that in one of the two studies, the infection prevention and control programme was focused on one pathogen only and limited to one hospital and thus its relevance might be questionable. Despite the limited published evidence and its very low quality, the Guidelines Development Group unanimously recommended that an infection prevention and control programme should be in place in all acute health care facilities and that the strength of this recommendation should be strong. This decision was based on the large effect of health care-associated infection reduction reported in the two studies and on the panel\u2019s conviction that the existence of an infection prevention and control programme is the necessary premise for any infection prevention and control action. Remarks \u2022 The content of section 1a is strongly linked to section 1b, thus providing a good practice statement and details about the organization of a national infection prevention and control programme. The national and health care facility programmes should be closely connected and work in synergy. \u2022 The organization of infection prevention and control programmes must have clearly defined objectives based on local epidemiology and priorities according to risk assessment and functions that align with and contribute towards the prevention of health care-associated infection and the spread of antimicrobial resistance in health care. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group identified that infection prevention and control programmes should cover defined activities. As a minimum, these include: \u203a\u203a Surveillance of HAIs and antimicrobial resistance. \u203a\u203a infection prevention and control activities related to patients, visitors and health care workers\u2019 safety and the prevention of antimicrobial resistance transmission. \u203a\u203a Development or adaptation of guidelines and standardization of effective preventive practices (standard operating procedures) and their implementation. \u203a\u203a Outbreak prevention and response, including triage, screening, and risk assessment especially during community outbreaks of communicable disease. \u203a\u203a Health care worker education and practical training. \u203a\u203a Maintaining effective aseptic techniques for health care practices. \u203a\u203a Assessment and feedback of compliance with infection prevention and control practices. \u203a\u203a Assurance of continuous procurement of adequate supplies relevant for infection prevention and control practices, including innovative equipment when necessary, as well as functioning Water sanitation and hygiene services that include water and sanitation facilities and a health care waste disposal infrastructure. \u203a\u203a Assurance that patient care activities are undertaken in a clean and hygienic environment and supported by adequate infrastructures. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group considers that it is critical for a functioning infection prevention and control programme to have dedicated, trained professionals in every acute care facility. A minimum ratio of one full-time or equivalent infection preventionist (nurse or physician) ",
                "2": "per 250 beds (37) should be available. However, there was a strong opinion that a higher ratio should be considered, for example, one infection preventionist per 100 beds, due to increasing patient acuity and complexity, as well as the multiple roles and responsibilities of the modern preventionist (38). For this reason, it is important that all infection preventionists are subject to review and regular updates of infection control competencies (refer to Core component #3: Infection prevention and control education and training). \u2022 Although the scope of the evidence review and these recommendations addresses acute care facilities, the Guidelines Development Group considered it equally critical that all types of health care facilities have infection prevention and control support. Depending on the size and type of facility, such support might include an infection prevention and control committee comprising a trained and dedicated team to support several facilities and a \u201croaming\u201d infection preventionist with regularly scheduled visits to support \u2022 outpatient and other peripheral facilities. Clinics providing specialized treatment and care for patients with highly transmissible communicable diseases (for example, tuberculosis) should have an infection prevention and control programme or an on-site service to support the prevention of disease spread. \u2022 Reporting lines for infection prevention and control teams should be clear both within facilities and externally. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group was of the opinion that health facility infection prevention and control programmes should be aligned to national programmes and interlinked with public health initiatives and the International Health Regulations, in particular for the reporting of communicable diseases or other unusual events of relevance for public health to the appropriate local, regional and national authorities, including those related to antimicrobial resistance. Thus, efficient means of communication should be in place between facilities, authorities and other public health services. \u2022 Additional consideration should be given to data management systems as they are needed to support infection prevention and control activities. Background infection prevention and control programmes are one component of safe, high-quality health service delivery. health care-associated infection are one of the most common complications or adverse events affecting patients and health care workers. They result in increased morbidity and mortality and impact on the capacity of health systems to function effectively. health care-associated infection also increase health care costs and can result in the increased usage of antimicrobial agents, thereby fuelling the problem of antimicrobial resistance. In 2011, World Health Organization reported that 7% of patients in developed and 10% in developing countries will acquire at least one health care-associated infection at any given time. Limited data are available from low- and middle-income countries, but the prevalence of health care-associated infection is estimated to be between 5.7% and 19.1%. A World Health Organization survey published in 2015 (39) explored existing national policies and activities in the area of antimicrobial resistance in 133 Member States to determine the existence of effective practices and structures and highlight gaps. This situational analysis revealed major weaknesses in infection prevention and control capacity. Relatively few countries had a national infection prevention and control programme (54/133; 41%) in place and even fewer reported a programme in all tertiary hospitals (39/133; 29%). At least half of all Member States in the European, South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions reported having such a programme. However, fewer stated that this extended across all tertiary hospitals. In the African Region, a national infection prevention and control programme was present in 11 (42%) countries, with only four (15%) having such a programme in all tertiary hospitals (39). The inventory of infection prevention and control national strategy or action plan documents conducted as part of the background for these guidelines showed that across all regions the vast majority of these documents (85%) address infection prevention and control programme structure and goals. However, only 60% specify the importance of having qualified and dedicated staff to support the programme and 44% highlight the need for an adequate budget and Water sanitation and hygiene infrastructure (web Appendix III). Considering the above-mentioned issues, the Guidelines Development Group explored the evidence captured within a systematic review to identify the requirements and effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes to improve infection prevention and control practices and reduce health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance. ",
                "3": "Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix I) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes established at the acute health care facility level. The primary outcomes were specific health care-associated infection rates and hand hygiene compliance. Only two studies (one controlled before-after study (37) and one interrupted time series) (40) were included, both from one high-income country. The report of Haley and colleagues describes a landmark study in the field of infection prevention and control. Following implementation of an infection prevention and control programme including one full-time infection control nurse per 250 beds, urinary tract infection, pneumonia (post-surgery) and bacteraemia were reduced significantly among high risk patients by 31%, 27% and 15%, respectively (37). Among low risk patients, urinary tract infection and pneumonia (medical patients) were reduced significantly by 44% and 13%, respectively (37). Protection against health care-associated infection waned as the number of occupied beds per full-time equivalent infection control nurse increased from 250 to 400 beds and then levelled off (37). Furthermore, the study showed that significant increases of secular trends for surgical site infections, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and bacteraemia (+13.8%, +18.5%, +9.3% and +25.5%, respectively) were observed in facilities (33%) with no established infection prevention and control programme compared to hospitals with infection prevention and control programmes. Of note, significant decreases for surgical site infections, urinary tract infection and bacteraemia (-48%, -35.8, and -27.6%, respectively) were observed in the latter group (37). Mermel and colleagues reported the results of a hospital- wide, multidisciplinary 6-pronged approach to combat endemic Clostridium difficile infection. The most notable interventions were the development of an infection prevention and control action plan, improved monitoring and surveillance, improved sensitivity of C. difficile toxin testing, enhanced cleaning and an appropriate treatment plan (40). An overall decrease in C. difficile incidence was observed from 12.2/1000 discharges during the second quarter of 2006 to 3.6/1000 discharges during the third quarter of 2012 (P<0.005) (40). When applying the Effective practice and organisation of care risk of bias assessment to both studies, the Guidelines Development Group agreed that there is very low quality of evidence showing that infection prevention and control programmes are effective in preventing health care-associated infection as both studies demonstrated an overall high risk of bias. In the study by Haley and colleagues (37), the allocation sequence generation and concealment was considered as a high risk, while the risk related to blinding to the primary outcome remained unclear. In the report of Mermel and colleagues (40), both the shape of the intervention effect and data collection were high risk, while the intervention independence, blinding to the primary outcome and incomplete primary outcome data were unclear. Both studies were performed in a single high-income country (United States of America). It was noted also that the Haley study was conducted more than 30 years ago. Therefore, it is potentially not a reflection of the current complexity of health care, the remit of infection prevention and control programmes and the evolution in the roles and responsibilities of infection prevention and control personnel. While acknowledging the limitations of the evidence included in the systematic review, the Guidelines Development Group proposed that strong consideration be given to the Delphi project (38) as this publication is recognized internationally and takes into consideration the evolution of the roles and responsibilities of infection preventionists, as well as additional factors, such as the increasing acuity of patients and activity of health care settings. For these reasons, the Guidelines Development Group suggested a ratio of one infection preventionist to 100 hospital beds, but no less than the recommended one infection preventionist to 250 hospital beds, according to the evidence. Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that patients and the public are strongly supportive of infection prevention and control programmes, including the presence of infection preventionists, as an accepted strategy to reduce the risk of health care-associated infection. Furthermore, health care providers and policy-makers across all settings are likely to be in support of infection prevention and control programmes and staff to reduce the harm caused by health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance and to achieve safe, quality health service delivery in the context of universal health coverage. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the recommendation can be accomplished in all countries, but it did acknowledge that there will be particular resource implications for low- and middle-income countries, most notably, limited access to qualified and trained infection prevention and control professionals. At present, a defined career path for infection prevention and control does not exist in some countries, thus restricting health care workers professional development. Furthermore, human resource capacity is often limited, especially with respect to available doctors. Many countries have an experience of implementing infection prevention and control programmes and data from high- and middle-income countries indicate that it is feasible and effective. However, in settings with limited resources, there is a need for prioritization and use of the most effective approaches. Finally, the Guidelines Development Group agreed that not all countries will have adequate budgets and expertise to fully support all aspects ",
                "4": "of an infection prevention and control programme when executed to its fullest extent. Although the evidence is limited to high-resource settings, the expert panel believes that the resources invested are worth the net gain, irrespective of the context. Thus, the provision of secured budget lines will be important to support the full implementation of infection prevention and control activities. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable, while recognizing that it requires widespread and executive support, as well as specific actions for stakeholder engagement. The need for effective advocacy to assist in the acceptance of the recommendation moving forward was noted. Conclusions After careful evaluation of the available evidence, the panel recommended that an infection prevention and control programme with a dedicated, trained team should be in place in each acute health care facility for the purpose of preventing health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance. The panel also believes that all types of health care facility should have some form of infection prevention and control support from a trained team, with scope and time dedication depending on the type of facility. Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group indicated the need for additional well-designed research studies, especially from low- and middle-income countries, as the only available evidence is from high-income countries, which is difficult to apply more broadly. Furthermore, there is a strong request for more investigations that examine the impact and ideal composition of an infection prevention and control programme, including minimum standards for infection prevention and control training, and studies on cost-effectiveness to determine adequate budgeting for infection prevention and control activities. The Guidelines Development Group also highlighted that more insight is needed on the impact of an effective infection prevention and control programme in support of strategies to improve hygiene and infection prevention and control in the community. Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined a number of additional points to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group unanimously agreed that nursing staff must be engaged to form a central part of the infection prevention and control programme as the vast majority of health care in low- and middle-income countries is nurse- driven with less access to medical doctors than in high- income countries. Nevertheless, if resources permit, the Guidelines Development Group recommends that an infection prevention and control programme should have both doctors and nurses with specialized infection prevention and control training. In addition, cleaners and janitorial staff should be trained, as appropriate, on specific aspects of infection prevention and control. \u2022 The facility leadership should clearly support the infection prevention and control programme by providing materials and organizational and administrative support through the allocation of a protected and dedicated budget, according to the infection prevention and control activity plan. This budget should also ensure support for the adequate functioning of Water sanitation and hygiene services that are necessary to undertake infection prevention and control.  Importantly, the ultimate accountability for infection prevention and control programmes lies with the facility leadership. \u2022 Within the facility, the infection prevention and control team should have established links and communication mechanisms, in particular with the following services: laboratory and biosafety; waste management, sanitation, water supply, cleaning and sterilization; occupational health; pharmacy; and patient safety and quality of care. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized the importance of the infection prevention and control programme/team being linked with the occupational health professionals (if available) within the facility, to collaborate on all aspects of health care worker safety relevant to infection prevention, such as post-exposure prophylaxis, outbreak management, choosing optimal personal protective equipment, etc. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group identified that good quality microbiological laboratory support is a very critical factor for an effective infection prevention and control programme. The identification and characterization of the aetiological agents responsible for infection is especially useful for the early detection of outbreaks where the identification of the pathogen concerned and/or distinct patterns of antimicrobial resistance are crucial. It also provides data on the local endemic epidemiology of health care-associated infection and local antimicrobial resistance patterns, which can all provide relevant information for policy and action plan development. Use of antimicrobial consumption data can provide relevant information for the development of antibiotic formulary guidelines and an action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance. ",

National infection prevention and control programmes should be linked with other relevant national programmes and professional organizations. Rationale for the good practice statement \u2022 Although several studies concerning the implementation of nationwide multimodal programmes with the aim to reduce specific types of infections (for example, catheter-associated bloodstream infection) were retrieved, no study was available to evaluate the effectiveness of establishing a more comprehensive national infection prevention and control programme and its organization and therefore to formulate a recommendation. However, experts and country representatives brought very clear examples where an active and sustained national infection prevention and control programme with effectively implemented plans has led to the improvement of national health care-associated infection rates and/or the reduction of infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Therefore, the Guidelines Development Group strongly affirmed that each country should have a stand-alone, active national infection prevention and control programme to prevent health care-associated infection, to combat antimicrobial resistance through infection prevention and control good practices and ultimately achieve safe, high-quality health service delivery. Remarks \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group strongly concurred that the organization of national infection prevention and control programmes must be established with clear objectives, functions, appointed infection preventionists and a defined scope of responsibilities.

This includes the development of national plans for preventing health care-associated infection, the development or strengthening of national policies and standards of practice regarding infection prevention and control activities in health care facilities, and the associated monitoring of the implementation of and adherence to these national policies and standards. Therefore, the panel unanimously agreed that national infection prevention and control activities are essential to support health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance prevention among patients, health care workers and visitors. \u2022 The International Health Regulations require Member States to notify World Health Organization of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern and outline the importance of infection prevention and control practices at the health care facility level for the purposes of containment following such events (14). The current monitoring and assessment tool for International Health Regulations core capacity (16) strongly features infection prevention and control, which is specifically mentioned as one of 20 indicators: \u201cinfection prevention and control is established and functioning at national and hospital levels\u201d (16). International Health Regulations monitoring and evaluation is currently under review and infection prevention and control is anticipated to feature strongly in the new approach (expected to be published in 2016). \u2022 The linkages between the national infection prevention and control programme and other related programmes are key and should be established and maintained including: \u203a\u203a Water sanitation and hygiene \u203a\u203a Environmental authorities \u203a\u203a Prevention and containment of antimicrobial resistance, including an antimicrobial stewardship programme \u203a\u203a Tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and other priority public health programmes "

The Guidelines Development Group noted that the basic set of infection prevention and control guidelines should include at least the following: \u203a\u203a Standard precautions \u203a\u203a hand hygiene \u203a\u203a use of personal protective equipment \u203a\u203a sterilization and medical devices decontamination \u203a\u203a safe handling of linen and laundry \u203a\u203a health care waste management \u203a\u203a patient placement \u203a\u203a espiratory hygiene and cough etiquette \u203a\u203a environmental cleaning \u203a\u203a principles of asepsis \u203a\u203a prevention of injuries from sharp instruments and post-exposure prophylaxis \u203a\u203a Transmission-based precautions \u203a\u203a Aseptic technique and device management for clinical procedures, according to the scope of care. Since the scope of practices may be very different in health care facilities according to the type of care offered, the guidelines should prioritize the most frequent and/or risky practices (for example, use of indwelling catheters and other devices, surgery, and other invasive procedures) and settings (for example, operating room, ICUs, neonatal wards, central reprocessing, hemodialysis unit, etc.). \u2022 National infection prevention and control programmes must support the development and enhancement of advanced educational programmes on this topic. Three categories of human resources were identified as targets for infection prevention and control training. \u2022 infection prevention and control specialists: members of the technical teams responsible for infection prevention and control programmes who should be trained to achieve an expert level covering all areas of infection prevention and control. \u2022 All health care workers involved in service delivery and patient care: clinical staff (doctors, nurses, dentists, medical assistants, etc.), laboratory and other health care workers (for example, cleaners) who require a basic understanding of all relevant infection prevention and control measures embedded within clinical procedures, precautions for biohazard security and risks associated with the health care environment. \u203a\u203a Other personnel that support health service delivery: these include administrative, managerial and all other support staff (for example, local authorities and hospital administrators/managers and executive leaders) responsible and accountable for the safety and quality of health services who should understand the importance of supporting infection prevention and control infrastructure and practices to reduce overall harm to patients and frontline health workers and associated costs. \u2022 Early participation of stakeholders (health authorities, health care facilities, scientific societies, patient organizations, Water sanitation and hygiene professional groups and ministries of health) in the production of national standards and guidelines may contribute to achieving consensus and facilitating their implementation. ",
                "7": "Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined a number of additional points to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group outlined a basic set of key activities that the national infection prevention and control team should lead, which should include aspects related to: \u203a\u203a Surveillance of HAIs, as well as antimicrobial resistance, and dissemination of data \u203a\u203a Ensuring implementation of at least: -- standard precautions -- transmission-based precautions -- appropriate selection and use of infection prevention and control supplies (for example, personal protective equipment, hand hygiene products, antiseptics, etc.) -- preventative techniques for clinical procedures (that is, sterile procedures, surgery, catheter insertion) -- sterilization and disinfection of clinical materials -- waste management, adequate access to safe water, sanitation and environmental cleaning \u203a\u203a Development of national technical guidelines, standard operating procedures and implementation strategies \u203a\u203a Outbreak prevention and response, including ensuring that a national plan is in place \u203a\u203a Training of health care workers \u203a\u203a Assessment and feedback of compliance with infection prevention and control practices (including the dissemination and use of data) \u203a\u203a Assurance of national procurement of adequate supplies relevant for infection prevention and control practices \u203a\u203a Coordination or collaboration with relevant ministries \u203a\u203a Monitoring and evaluation of the national infection prevention and control programme. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group agreed that the programme might use local experience and knowledge obtained from successful interventions as a base for the development of strategies. A system for the documentation and dissemination of successful local or national initiatives should be established to highlight examples of effective interventions and their implementation. In particular, these need to have a focus on their effectiveness in the context of existing resources, while taking into account the local culture and specific setting. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group considered it beneficial that an official multidisciplinary group, committee or an equivalent structure be established to interact with the technical team responsible for the infection prevention and control programme. The mandate of this entity would be to integrate infection prevention and control in the national health system and enhance cooperation, coordination and information-sharing, particularly with national bodies responsible for quality policy and strategy and universal health coverage. Other tasks of the group could be to perform a review of the programme content, promote improved practices, ensure appropriate training, review risks associated with new technologies and periodically evaluate the programme. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group highlighted that good quality microbiological support to clinical laboratories provided by at least one national reference laboratory is a critical factor for an effective national infection prevention and control programme. The identification and characterization of the aetiological agents responsible for infection is especially useful for the early detection and the microbiological confirmation of outbreaks, which may have national or sub-national relevance, including identification of the pathogen and/or a distinct pattern of antimicrobial resistance. Microbiology support also provides national data on the epidemiology of health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance patterns, which can provide relevant information for policies and the development of action plans. Strict adherence to laboratory standards and biosafety measures are vital for effective microbiological techniques and unbiased interpretations of results. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized the regulatory aspect and importance of national infection prevention and control standards, including the development, dissemination and implementation of technical evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of the relevant risks informed by local risk assessment and/ or infections adapted to local conditions. The Guidelines Development Group noted that the basic set of infection prevention and control guidelines should include at least the following: \u203a\u203a Standard precautions -- hand hygiene -- use of personal protective equipment -- sterilization and medical devices decontamination -- safe handling of linen and laundry -- health care waste management -- patient placement -- respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette -- environmental cleaning -- principles of asepsis -- prevention of injuries from sharp instruments and post-exposure prophylaxis \u203a\u203a Transmission-based precautions \u203a\u203a Aseptic technique and device management for clinical procedures, according to the scope of care. Since the scope of practices may be very different in health care facilities according to the type of care offered, the guidelines should prioritize the most frequent and/or risky practices (for example, use of indwelling catheters and other devices, surgery, and other invasive procedures) and settings (for example, operating room, ICUs, neonatal wards, central reprocessing, hemodialysis unit, etc.).

                "9": "Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix I) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was the use of guidelines in combination with the education and training of health care workers. The primary outcome was the impact on health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of six studies comprising three non- controlled before-after studies (41-43) , one non-controlled interrupted time series (44) and two qualitative studies (45, 46) were retrieved through the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) , which is part of the evidence for these guidelines. Three reports were from an upper-middle-income country (Argentina) and the remaining ones were from the United States of America. Larson and colleagues highlighted the importance of guideline implementation in the field in a survey involving 1158 health care workers in 40 hospitals in the United States of America. They found that although health care workers were aware of the update of a national guideline on hand hygiene, the recommendations had been implemented only in less than half of the hospitals visited (41) . A study by Rubinson and colleagues showed a low adherence to maximal sterile barrier precautions for the insertion of central venous catheters by internists. Among those who were highly adherent, only a minority was aware of the content of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (45) . The conclusion was that knowledge of guidelines alone is insufficient for behavioural change. Moreover, attitudes towards guidelines were more positive among nurses than doctors and in paediatric ICUs than in adult ICUs (46) . The introduction of a new guideline as part of a multimodal intervention strategy in settings without previous exposure to standardized protocols helped to improve hand hygiene and to reduce rates of  catheter-associated urinary tract infection (42-44) in the context of a national network in Argentina. As the included studies were all from the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) and they do not meet the recommended study designs by the Effective practice and organisation of care group (9) , the Guidelines Development Group considered that the overall quality of the evidence was very low. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies In the update of the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review performed for these guidelines, one additional study was retrieved (web Appendix I) that concurs with the evidence summarized above, but it did not meet the Effective practice and organisation of care study design criteria. In this study by Kachare and colleagues (non-controlled before-after), the implementation of hospital-wide catheter guidelines and specific measures aimed at early catheter removal demonstrated an 85% significant reduction in the number of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and increased hand hygiene compliance (58% vs. 92%, respectively; P=0.05) (47) . Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the typical values and preferences of health care providers, policy- makers and patients would favour this intervention. Health care providers, policy-makers and health care workers are likely to place a high value on evidence-based guidelines. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation, while recognizing that the implementation and local adaptation of technical guidelines will require some level of resources and materials. This will include the necessary human resources for development and adaptation, as well as materials and equipment for execution, although some solutions may likely be low cost. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be accomplished in all countries. However, the panel did note that feasibility would hinge on the presence of infection prevention and control programmes, infection prevention and control expertise and availability of materials and equipment to assist in appropriate local adaptation. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable. Conclusions After careful evaluation of the evidence, the Guidelines Development Group recommended that evidence-based practice guidelines should be developed and implemented for the purpose of reducing HAIs and antimicrobial resistance as part of a broad multimodal improvement approach including health care workers\u2019 education and training. Research gaps During the Guidelines Development Group discussions, particular gaps in the available research were identified.

This group of professionals should be trained to achieve an expert level of knowledge covering all areas relevant to infection prevention and control, including patient and health care worker safety and quality improvement. To maintain high-level expertise, it is important that all infection prevention and control specialists undergo regular updates of their competencies. \u203a\u203a All health care workers involved in service delivery and patient care: clinical staff (doctors, nurses, dentists, medical assistants, etc.), laboratory and other health care workers (for example, cleaners).  In particular, these professionals should understand infection prevention and control measures embedded within clinical procedures, the importance of precautions for biohazard security and the risks associated with the environment. \u203a\u203a Other personnel that support health service delivery: these include cleaners responsible for the day-to-day cleaning of the facility, auxiliary service staff and administrative and managerial staff (for example, local authorities and hospital administrators/managers and executive leaders) responsible and accountable for the safety and quality of health service delivery, including the overall implementation of policies and guidelines and the monitoring of national and local policies. Senior managers should understand the importance of supporting infection prevention and control infrastructure and practices to reduce harm to patient and health care workers and therefore the associated costs. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized that strong consideration should be given to incorporating in-service mentorship into health facilities as it has been shown to be successful in achieving behaviour change in other fields. One example could be the use of infection prevention and control link practitioners as unit-based resources or champions. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group strongly agreed that periodic evaluations of both the effectiveness of training programmes and assessments of staff knowledge should be undertaken on a routine basis to ensure optimal education delivery, uptake and practice.

                "12": "Background infection prevention and control education spans all domains of health service delivery and is relevant to all health care workers, ranging from frontline workers to administrative management. Effective infection prevention and control education and training is predicated on employing the right educational method to achieve maximal learning and behaviour change. Education and training must be pertinent and relevant to the tasks that each worker is required to perform. Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix I) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was health care worker training and education on infection prevention and control good practices. The primary outcome was the impact on health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of 15 studies comprising five interrupted case series (48-52) , five qualitative (46, 53-56) , two controlled before-after (57, 58) , two non-controlled before-after (59, 60) and one mixed methods (61) were included. Twelve studies were from high-income countries (46, 48-51, 54-57, 59-61) , two from one upper-middle-income country (52, 58) and one from a LMIC (53) . In six studies, a reduction of catheter-related bloodstream infections were associated with bedside teaching as a prominent part of multimodal interventions (60) , including simulation-based training (48, 49, 57) and hands-on or in- person training workshops (50, 59) . In a study by Viana and colleagues, the introduction of an educational module for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia was associated with an overall reduction in mean ventilator- associated pneumonia rates (52) . Conversely, the introduction of a volunteer, self-directed, automated training system for hand hygiene by Kwok and colleagues did not result in any change in overall hand hygiene compliance (51) . Although formal training can be effective (52, 56) , individual experience is perceived to be more important for infection prevention and control (54) . As an example, strategies that use traditional approaches based on logic and reasoning were perceived as less likely to improve hand hygiene (55) . In three studies, the use of multidisciplinary focus groups to engage frontline health care workers was crucial to identify common infection prevention and control strategies and contributed to improved hand hygiene compliance and reduced rates of health care-associated infection (53, 58, 61) . The overall quality of this evidence was considered as moderate by the Guidelines Development Group given that the studies included in the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) were graded as high quality. However, most trials did not meet the recommended Effective practice and organisation of care study designs (9) and the studies identified by the update of the review had a medium to high risk of bias. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies In the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review update, an additional 21 studies comprising 20 non-controlled before-after (62-81) and one non-controlled cohort trial (82) were retrieved (web Appendix I) . Although they did not meet the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria (9) , it was considered that these studies could provide further insight into effective infection prevention and control educational approaches. Hands-on or in-person group training sessions as part of multimodal interventions (68, 70) , including e-learning modules (62, 69) , task-oriented training sessions (64) and lectures (63, 65-67) , were associated with increased hand hygiene compliance (81) and decreased health care-associated infection (80) . Simulation-based training (71, 76) was associated with a decrease in catheter-related bloodstream infection. Dedicated teams or infection prevention and control link nurses/practitioners were also associated with decreased methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition (75) , increased hand hygiene (75) and decreased catheter-related bloodstream infection (82) . In two studies, group sessions with online modules and lectures were associated with an overall reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia (77, 78) , while more targeted training courses for specialized care showed a decrease in bloodstream infection (72, 73, 79) . Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that health care providers, policy-makers and patients in all settings are likely to place value on the need for effective training and education as part of a multimodal strategy to reduce health care-associated infection and to combat antimicrobial resistance. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation. However, it recognizes that certain educational and training methods may pose an implementation challenge in some low-resource settings. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be accomplished in all countries and acknowledges that continuous education may be difficult and challenging in ",
                "13": "some countries, particularly where there is a low availability or lack of knowledgeable professionals able to teach infection prevention and control. In addition, the recommendation is likely to require adaptation or tailoring to the cultural setting. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable. Conclusions Following careful evaluation of the available evidence, the Guidelines Development Group recommended that infection prevention and control training and education should be in place for all health care workers using team- and task- based strategies, including bedside and simulation training, to reduce the risk of HAIs and combat antimicrobial resistance. Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group emphasized the need to ensure that lessons learned from innovative new programmes are evaluated and utilized for improving infection prevention and control education and training delivery. Moreover, more research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of e-learning, self-directed training modules and mentorship as tools for infection prevention and control education and their associated impact on health care-associated infection. Additional studies are required to better understand the impact of patient and family education on health care-associated infection. Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined a number of additional points to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group agreed that the infection prevention and control team should be responsible for the design and development of infection prevention and control education and training within the facility. Providing basic infection prevention and control training may not necessarily be the task of only the infection prevention and control teams, but a part of a larger training approach (for example, train the trainer) to maximize available human resources. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group noted that educational approaches should be informed by behavioural change theories and methods. The Guidelines Development Group also emphasized that in addition to teaching the basic concepts and theories of microbiology, infectious diseases and infection prevention and control, consideration should be given to using a range of educational modalities to maximize the impact of health care worker training. The following training methods could be included: problem-based learning; hands-on workshops; focus groups; peer-to-peer training; classroom-based simulation; and bedside training. Such training should be complementary to Water sanitation and hygiene training and, if this does not exist, key Water sanitation and hygiene aspects necessary for infection prevention and control implementation should be incorporated. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group discussed the possibility of using a twinning partnership model, such as that used by the African Partnerships for Patient Safety (http://www.who.int/ patientsafety/implementation/apps/en/), a World Health Organization patient safety programme, to support local infection prevention and control training. This model facilitated the development of sustainable hospital- to-hospital patient safety partnerships centred on infection prevention and control and advocated patient safety as a precondition of health care. A twinning partnership approach has the potential to increase access to technical resources (for example, infection prevention and control expertise) and to provide support for appropriate local infection prevention and control training. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group recognized that although there was no evidence on the benefits of patient education, patient empowerment remains an important consideration. In particular, whenever family members assume care activities, they should receive targeted or tailored infection prevention and control training in order to protect themselves and their loved ones and thus minimize any possibility of cross-transmission.

                "14": "GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENT The national infection prevention and control programme should support education and training of the health workforce as one of its core functions. Rationale for the good practice statement \u2022 Several studies related to the implementation of nationwide multimodal programmes were retrieved (see Core component 5). These included a strong health care worker education and training component with the aim to reduce specific types of infections (for example, catheter-associated bloodstream infections). In addition, health care worker training was found to be an essential component for effective guidelines implementation (see Core component 2). However, there was no specific evidence on the effectiveness of national curricula or infection prevention and control education and training per se. Nevertheless, the Guidelines Development Group deemed it important to develop a good practice statement to recommend that infection prevention and control national programmes should support education and training of the health workforce as one of its core functions to prevent HAIs and antimicrobial resistance and to achieve safe, high-quality health service delivery. Remarks \u2022 The infection prevention and control national team plays a key role to support and make infection prevention and control training happen at the facility level as described in section 3a. \u2022 The ultimate aim of this activity is to have the presence of a skilled and knowledgeable health workforce. This should include both infection prevention and control specialists and all professionals with a solid basic infection prevention and control knowledge among health care workers involved in service delivery and patient care, as well as senior managers. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group highlighted that in order to support the development and maintenance of a skilled, knowledgeable health workforce, national infection prevention and control curricula should be developed in collaboration with local academic institutions. Curricula should be developed for both pre-graduate and postgraduate courses. The former are intended to provide students in the health domain with a basic solid education on infection prevention and control principles and best practices, whereas the latter are intended to train professionals to become infection prevention and control specialists by creating a career path and an infection prevention and control specialty. In the curricula development process, it is advisable to refer to international curricula and networks for specialized infection prevention and control programmes and to adapt these documents and approaches to national needs and local available resources. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group identified also that the national infection prevention and control programme should provide guidance and recommendations for in- service training to be rolled out at the facility level according to detailed infection prevention and control core competencies for health care workers and covering all professional categories listed in core component 3a. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group agreed that supporting and facilitating training at all levels should be considered as an important indicator for assessing the relevance of infection prevention and control programmes. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group noted that in addition to general infection prevention and control educational activities, the need for specific training to support the implementation of national health care-associated infection surveillance activities is critical to ensure their efficiency and reliability.

This should include both infection prevention and control specialists and all professionals with a solid basic infection prevention and control knowledge among health care workers involved in service delivery and patient care, as well as senior managers. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group highlighted that in order to support the development and maintenance of a skilled, knowledgeable health workforce, national infection prevention and control curricula should be developed in collaboration with local academic institutions. Curricula should be developed for both pre-graduate and postgraduate courses. The former are intended to provide students in the health domain with a basic solid education on infection prevention and control principles and best practices, whereas the latter are intended to train professionals to become infection prevention and control specialists by creating a career path and an infection prevention and control specialty. In the curricula development process, it is advisable to refer to international curricula and networks for specialized infection prevention and control programmes and to adapt these documents and approaches to national needs and local available resources. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group identified also that the national infection prevention and control programme should provide guidance and recommendations for in- service training to be rolled out at the facility level according to detailed infection prevention and control core competencies for health care workers and covering all professional categories listed in core component 3a. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group agreed that supporting and facilitating training at all levels should be considered as an important indicator for assessing the relevance of infection prevention and control programmes. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group noted that in addition to general infection prevention and control educational activities, the need for specific training to support the implementation of national health care-associated infection surveillance activities is critical to ensure their efficiency and reliability.

                "16": "The Guidelines Development Group agreed that hospital-based infection surveillance systems should be linked to integrated public health infection surveillance systems. Information regarding diseases of potential concern should be reported immediately to the public health authorities. This is in agreement with the requirements of the International Health Regulations for 2005, which have been in force since June 2007.The International Health Regulations require Member States to develop the capacity to detect and report organisms (including those due to newly emerged resistance) that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern with associated notification to World Health Organization. Likewise, infection prevention and control practices in health care must be in place for the purposes of containment following such events. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized that surveillance reports should be disseminated in a timely manner to those at the managerial or administration level (decision-makers) and the unit/ward level (frontline health care workers). The importance of sharing reports with all relevant players was noted in order to support both organizational and behavioural change as part of overall quality improvement efforts to reduce the risk of health care-associated infection and combat antimicrobial resistance (see core component 6, which provides further information related to the role of feedback in improvement). Dissemination of reports to committees responsible for safety and quality should be considered also since data on health care-associated infection are a quality marker. Background infection prevention and control activities should respond to the actual needs of the health care facility, based on the health care-associated infection situation and compliance with infection prevention and control practices. Facility-based surveillance systems contribute to the early detection of health care-associated infection, the identification of clusters and outbreaks and enable the effectiveness of infection prevention and control interventions to be assessed. All surveillance systems should rely on good data quality, which includes the appropriate application of case definitions and good microbiological laboratory procedures. The latter is necessary for the identification of aetiological agents and antimicrobial resistance patterns as these have several implications for patients and infection prevention and control programmes. In a recent World Health Organization survey conducted in 2015 on the global situational analysis of antimicrobial resistance, many regions noted poor laboratory capacity, infrastructure and data management as impediments to surveillance (39) . The World Health Organization Global antimicrobial resistance Surveillance System fosters the development of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and suggests that countries should rely on at least one externally quality- assured reference laboratory to support antimicrobial resistance surveillance in the country (83) . In addition, laboratory capacity varied by country and by region. The highest percentage of countries in which organisms are tested for antibiotic sensitivity was in the Region of the Americas. Although a national reference laboratory was reported by one country in each region, many did not participate in external quality assessments to ensure data quality on antimicrobial resistance. With the exception of 2 regions where most countries reported on antimicrobial resistance surveillance, national reports on this topic were infrequent (39) . Moreover, in the inventory of infection prevention and control national strategy or action plan documents conducted as the background for these guidelines, it was noted that most documents (79%) contain guidance relating to the establishment of priorities for surveillance, despite some regional variation (web Appendix III). However, only 52% of documents address the need for standardized definitions with clear gaps in recommending surveillance in the context of outbreak response and detection. Taking into consideration the strong emphasis on surveillance, together with laboratory support and feedback, the Guidelines Development Group reviewed the available evidence to determine the impact of surveillance on HAIs. Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix I) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was health care-associated infection surveillance and feedback. The primary outcome was health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of 13 studies comprising 11 non-controlled before- after (84-94) , one interrupted time series (95) and one qualitative study (96) were included, all from high-income countries. Hospital-based infection surveillance systems linked to national surveillance networks were associated with decreased rates of overall health care-associated infection (84-89, 93, 94) , central line-associated  bloodstream infection (87, 88) , ventilator- associated pneumonia (87, 94) , urinary tract infection (86) and surgical site infections (84, 85, 87, 89, 90) . Hospitals within the Dutch national surveillance network showed reduced rates of health care-associated infection during years 4 and 5 (90) after surveillance started, while the 35 ICUs of the French surveillance network demonstrated a reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infection over 5 years (91) . Active surveillance with public feedback as part of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bundle strategy was associated with a decrease in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in a hospital in Singapore (95) . One qualitative study explored the importance of surveillance and feedback to stakeholders and found that they were very influential in the implementation of an infection prevention and control programme targeting ventilator-associated pneumonia (96). ",
                "17": "The quality of the evidence was graded as intermediate according to Integrated quality criteria for review of multiple study designs criteria for the studies retrieved through the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) . However, given that these studies do not meet the Effective practice and organisation of care recommended study design criteria (9) , the Guidelines Development Group considered this evidence as very low quality.  One study was identified through the review update and met the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria, but it had a high risk of bias. All studies were performed in high-income countries only and, therefore, generalizability is uncertain or limited with regards to applicability in low- and middle-income countries. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies An additional eight studies comprising four non-controlled cohort trials (97-100) and three non-controlled before-after (101-104) were retrieved from the updated Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (web Appendix I). Although they did not meet the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria (9) , their content provided further insight related to participation in hospital-based surveillance. Hospital-based infection surveillance was associated with decreased rates of central line-associated bloodstream infection (101, 102) , ventilator- associated pneumonia (97, Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.) and surgical site infections (99, 103) . In one study, the introduction of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus policy emphasizing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surveillance in a neonate intensive care unit showed that surveillance may protect non-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus neonates from becoming colonized (100) . Introduction of an electronic surveillance system of isolation practices resulted in a small increase in isolation practices, but no changes in infection rates (104). Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the typical values and preferences of patients, health care workers, health care providers and policy-makers would favour hospital-based infection surveillance with timely feedback and results to stakeholders and appropriate national networks. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation. However, the Guidelines Development Group recognizes that its implementation is resource- intensive, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It was also noted that available human resources, microbiological/laboratory support, information technology and data management systems will have significant implications for the implementation of the recommendation. Furthermore, laboratory quality standards must be considered as these will affect the outcome of surveillance data and interpretation. Despite these potential resource implications, the Guidelines Development Group regards the function of surveillance as important and going beyond the reduction of health care-associated infection. In addition, clinical health care-associated infection surveillance can be a low-cost alternative when microbiological support is not available or severely limited. The 2009 World Health Organization Core components document (1) noted that surveillance activities are time-consuming and need to be balanced with the time needed for infection prevention and control activities. Feasibility While feasibility is likely to vary substantially in different settings, the Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be accomplished in all countries. However, local human resource (including technical capacities) and laboratory capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, will need to be evaluated and addressed. Additional education will likely be required to help standardize the audit and surveillance process across all countries. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable. Conclusions The Guidelines Development Group felt very strongly that health care-associated infection surveillance is critical for evaluating and guiding infection prevention and control interventions, as well as for the detection and prevention of health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance, despite the lack of available evidence. Based on careful evaluation of the available evidence, the Guidelines Development Group decided to strongly recommend that facility-based health care-associated infection surveillance should be performed to guide infection prevention and control interventions and detect outbreaks, with timely feedback of results to health care workers, stakeholders and through national networks. Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group acknowledged the inconsistent application of health care-associated infection standard definitions and believed that this issue requires special attention. In addition, to help standardize health care-associated infection definitions and their application, research should be conducted to identify and test reliable alternative health care-associated infection definitions that may be more appropriate for low-resource settings, for instance, based on clinical data. More research should be conducted to assess the reliability of surveillance based on currently available patient records and data from hospital information management systems. In addition, the Guidelines Development Group discussed the overall lack of available evidence evaluating innovative and novel surveillance technologies, as well as improving the understanding of the role of surveillance and feedback in affecting behavioural change. Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined a number of additional points to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 It is important to triangulate infection prevention and control data with Water sanitation and hygiene monitoring ",
                "18": "and services in health care facilities in effort to help identify the source of the problem; infrastructure, behaviour or both. \u2022 In general, the HAIs selected for surveillance purposes include those that are the most preventable. In particular, the following could be prioritized: \u203a\u203a Infections that may become epidemic in the health care facility. \u203a\u203a Infections in vulnerable populations, such as neonates, burn patients, patients in ICUs and immunocompromised hosts. \u203a\u203a Infections that may cause severe outcomes, such as high case fatality and patient morbidity and suffering. \u203a\u203a Infections caused by resistant microorganisms with an emphasis on multidrug- resistant pathogens. \u203a\u203a Infections associated with selected invasive devices or specific procedures, such as the use of intravascular devices, indwelling urinary catheters and surgery, among others. \u203a\u203a Infections that may affect health care workers in clinical, laboratory and other settings (for example, hepatitis B and C). \u2022 Several approaches to health care-associated infection surveillance exist and the scope can be facility-wide or unit-based. The most frequently used study designs are incidence and prevalence surveys. Either method has advantages and disadvantages. The former involves continuous surveillance over time and can be used to detect several infections or one specific type of infection. It has a higher sensitivity than prevalence studies and allows the timely detection of outbreaks, but it is much more resource- and time-consuming and also completely unfeasible in some settings. Prevalence surveys detect infection proportions at a specific time point (either on one day or a short period, usually of one week), but are not sensitive for the detection of outbreaks. This approach has lower sensitivity, but higher feasibility, as it is less time- and resource-consuming. Regularly repeated (for example, annually) prevalence surveys are the most frequently used approach. It is very important to adjust surveillance data according to the population case-mix and to collect data to enable stratification according to risk scores or indexes (for example, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score in critically ill patients or the US national nosocomial infections surveillance score for risk assessment in surgical patients). If adjusting for risk scores or indexes is not feasible or too labour-intensive, focusing surveillance on specific populations (for example, high risk types of surgery) or infections may be an easier way to consider confounders for the same purpose. A system for surveillance data quality assessment is of the utmost importance. \u2022 There are many important implications associated with the interpretation of data from clinical microbiology laboratories, which can cause important biases. These include: \u203a\u203a The quality of the microbiological laboratory techniques must be assured in order to obtain valid data for clinical decisions and epidemiological use. \u203a\u203a Clinical departments and services must follow adequate procedures for the collection and transport of samples to the microbiology laboratory. \u203a\u203a Information from clinical microbiology laboratories requires analysis in order to differentiate health care-associated infection from those acquired in the community and infection from colonization, including avoiding the double-counting of cases where more than one culture has been processed. \u203a\u203a The analysis of routine data from such laboratories is usually collected for individual patient care and may generate information on the aetiology and/or patterns of antimicrobial resistance of the most severe infections, but not necessarily of all infections or the predominant ones. \u2022 Reliable microbiological information is especially useful for the early detection of the pathogen concerned or a distinct emerging pattern of antimicrobial resistance involved in some outbreaks and the identification of the most frequent pathogens causing endemic health care-associated infection, and for understanding microbial and antimicrobial resistance spread. For infection prevention and control programmes, these data are essential to identify and put in place the most appropriate procedures to interrupt transmission, which may change in part, depending on the pathogen. \u2022 Considering the lack of good quality microbiological data in many settings around the world, the Guidelines Development Group discussed the acceptability and reliability of surveillance based on patient clinical information (or syndromic-based surveillance). Clinical surveillance can be more easily accomplished based on clinical signs (as determined by the health care practitioner or provider) and symptoms (as reported by the patient), but it has clear limitations and does not comply with international standard definitions in most cases. Experts agreed that an important area for research is to identify and/or adapt health care-associated infection definitions based more upon clinical data and to determine their predictive value, in particular to make surveillance more feasible in low- resource settings. \u2022 In settings that do not have access to quality laboratory services, process measurement and tracking (for example, hand hygiene compliance) may provide useful data for quality improvement. \u2022 Innovative approaches involving patients and family carers to help detect infection signs and encourage symptom reporting should be explored or more developed. For instance, surgical site infections very often manifests after discharge and patient reporting has the potential to add high value to surveillance. ",

                "20": "The Guidelines Development Group agreed that hospital-based infection surveillance systems need to be linked to the national surveillance system, which in turn feeds the public health infection surveillance system. In particular, the link to the national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system should be in place as health care facilities are considered to be high-risk settings for the selection and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Information regarding diseases of potential concern should be reported immediately to the public health authorities. This is in agreement with the requirements of the 2005 International Health Regulations, which have been in force since June 2007. The International Health Regulations require Member States to notify World Health Organization of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. Authorities and other public health services need efficient means of communication with national infection prevention and control programmes and other health care providers in order to disseminate knowledge, regulations, public health strategies/programmes or other information. These links are particularly important: \u203a\u203a during community outbreaks that may have an impact on health care facilities because the latter may need to care for unexpectedly large numbers of patients or because they may act as amplifiers of the outbreaks through increased risk of infection for other patients and/or health care workers; \u203a\u203a for the reporting of unusual relevant events to, from and/or between facilities, such as outbreaks or the emergence of a new pathogen or important antimicrobial resistance. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group highlighted the critical role of microbiology and laboratory capacity for national and hospital-based health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Standardized definitions and laboratory methods should be adopted. There are many important issues associated with the interpretation of data from clinical microbiology laboratories, which can cause important bias: \u203a\u203a The quality of the microbiological laboratory techniques must be assured in order to obtain valid data for clinical decisions and epidemiological use. \u203a\u203a Adequate procedures for the collection and transport of samples to the microbiology laboratory are an essential requisite to ensure quality and the national infection prevention and control programme should develop national standardized procedures to be followed at facility level. \u203a\u203a The analysis of microbiological data should produce information on the aetiology and patterns of antimicrobial resistance of at least the most frequent and severe infections. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized that good quality microbiological support provided by at least one national reference laboratory is a critical factor for an effective national infection prevention and control surveillance programme. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized that national surveillance health care-associated infection data are essential to assist policy-makers to prioritize and develop infection prevention and control evidence-based standards and influence decisions on appropriate antimicrobial resistance strategies and policies. Background infection prevention and control activities should respond to actual needs. In order to fulfill the objectives of infection prevention and control programmes, national surveillance systems for health care-associated infection, including antimicrobial resistance patterns, are an essential component. These will also contribute to the assessment of the impact of infection prevention and control interventions. National infection prevention and control surveillance systems feed in to general public health capacity building and the strengthening of essential public health functions. National surveillance programmes are also crucial for the early detection of some outbreaks and new patterns of antimicrobial resistance. The 2009 World Health Organization Core components document further describes a strong rationale for national surveillance systems supported by the requisite microbiology laboratory capacity and linked to national and regional public health programmes. In a recent World Health Organization survey (2015) on the global situational analysis of antimicrobial resistance, many regions have noted poor laboratory capacity, infrastructure and data management as impediments to surveillance (39) . In addition, laboratory capacity varied by country and by region. However, at least one national reference laboratory in each of the six regions was capable of testing for antibiotic sensitivity. The highest percentage of countries where organisms are tested for antibiotic sensitivity was found in the Region of the Americas (39) . Although a national reference laboratory was reported by one country in each region, many did not participate in external quality assessments to ensure data quality on antimicrobial resistance. With the exception of two regions in which most countries reported on antimicrobial resistance surveillance, national reports on this topic were infrequent (39) . In this same report, antimicrobial resistance among rapidly growing bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was monitored in all regions with over 60% of respondents in each region reporting this type of surveillance. Despite regional networks supporting surveillance in many countries, none includes all the countries in its respective region (39) . ",
                "21": "Moreover, in the inventory of infection prevention and control national strategies and action plans conducted as the background for these guidelines, it was noted that most documents (79%) contain guidance related to the establishment of priorities for surveillance, despite some regional variations (web Appendix III). However, only 52% of documents address the need for standardized definitions with clear gaps in recommending surveillance in the context of outbreak response and detection. Given the strong emphasis on surveillance, together with laboratory support and feedback, the Guidelines Development Group reviewed the available evidence to determine the impact of national surveillance on HAIs. Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix II) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was the establishment of national surveillance programmes with mechanisms for the timely feedback and benchmarking of national surveillance data with health care-associated infection as the primary outcome. One randomized controlled trial (106) conducted in ICUs in a high-income country was identified. McKinley and colleagues compared the effect of organizational level feedback on infection rates by providing risk-adjusted infection rates with and without national comparative data. Reporting local risk-adjusted infection rates to hospitals together with national comparative rates was associated with a significantly (P<0.001) lower device-associated infection rate (2.2 per 1000 patient days for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, 5.5 per 1000 patient days for central line-associated bloodstream infection and 13.4 per 1000 patient days for ventilator-associated pneumonia) compared to the control group (9.0 per 1000 patient days for catheter- associated urinary tract infection, 14.0 per 1000 patient days for central line-associated bloodstream infection and 25.0 per 1000 patient days for ventilator-associated pneumonia) (106) . This study was evaluated with a high risk of bias and the Guidelines Development Group considered the evidence from this study as very low quality. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies An additional 18 studies not meeting the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria (9) were identified [11 non-controlled cohort trials (103, 107-116) and seven non-controlled before-after (85-88, 90, 117, 118) ] (web Appendix II). Their findings indicated that when national surveillance programmes with mechanisms for timely feedback are introduced, there is a significant reduction in health care-associated infection rates, usually seen by surveillance programmes with a longer duration. In particular, this effect was observed in studies conducted in the following countries: (1) in Germany with surgical site infections (85, 87, 88) , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (111) , ventilator-associated pneumonia (88) , central line-associated bloodstream infections (88, 116) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (86) ; (2) in France with surgical site infections and multidrug-resistant organisms (107, 109, 110, 117) ; (3) in Italy with surgical site infections (113) ; (4) in Finland with C. difficile (112) ; (5) in  Switzerland with surgical site infections (115); and (6) in the United States of America with overall health care-associated infection (114). Similarly, the relative risk for patients developing postoperative surgical site infections reduced with the increased duration of a surgical site infections surveillance programme in years 4 and 5 compared to the initial launch (90) , while a mandatory surgical site infections inpatient surveillance programme observed a reduction in inpatient surgical site infections rates over an 8-year period (118). Likewise, when modelled for risk, a significant reduction in surgical site infections is observed over a longer period (103) . In one additional study, using national and international datasets as comparators for benchmarking allowed national infection prevention and control programmes to identify future infection prevention and control interventions (108) . Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the typical values and preferences of patients regarding this recommendation would favour national health care-associated infection surveillance with mechanisms for timely feedback to stakeholders and appropriate national networks. Furthermore, health care providers and policy-makers are likely to place a high value on national health care-associated infection surveillance programmes within the current context of antimicrobial resistance, the International Health Regulations and the international communities renewed action on essential public health functions required to protect and promote population health. Resource use The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources required are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation. However, it recognized that this recommendation is resource- intensive, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and could greatly impact on the ability to ensure quality data as poor data can have the inverse effect. This recommendation will greatly depend on available human resources with the requisite skills and knowledge, microbiological/laboratory support, information technology and data management systems. Surveillance activities are time-consuming and need to be balanced with the time needed for infection prevention and control activities. In addition, education will likely be required to help standardize surveillance processes country-wide. Despite these potential challenges regarding resource implications, the Guidelines Development Group considers that the function of surveillance is important and it can be used to direct health care-associated infection interventions and infection prevention and control strategies. ",
                "22": "Feasibility Despite the fact that the available evidence is from one high-income country, the Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be accomplished in all countries as the experience from high-income countries offers principles that are applicable also to low- and middle-income countries. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable. Conclusions Despite the lack of good quality evidence, the Guidelines Development Group felt strongly that national health care-associated infection surveillance is critical, in particular when taking into account the current global and national actions to address antimicrobial resistance and the prevention of outbreaks of highly transmissible microorganisms in the context of International Health Regulations enforcement. In addition, national surveillance programmes play a role in evaluating and targeting infection prevention and control interventions. For these reasons, the Guidelines Development Group agreed to recommend that national surveillance programmes including mechanisms for timely feedback should be established to reduce HAIs. Moreover, the Guidelines Development Group suggested that national surveillance data should be used for benchmarking purposes, where possible. Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group discussed the overall lack of high-quality evidence and highlighted that additional research evaluating national health care-associated infection surveillance and its impact on health care-associated infection reduction is required. In particular, data from low- and middle-income countries are lacking and research on this topic should be encouraged, including investigations about feasibility, resources needed and cost-effectiveness. The sensitivity and specificity of case definitions for each health care-associated infection needs to be addressed, in particular where microbiology laboratory access is limited or non-existent.\u00a0Urgent research is needed on adapted definitions for use in settings with limited or no access to good quality microbiology support, including the optimal duration of surveillance follow-up. The reliability and usefulness of automatic surveillance is another crucial topic that deserves further investigation. Furthermore, research should include the role of health care-associated infection surveillance as part of a network effort and investigate the most optimal feedback mechanisms for a functioning national programme. Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined a number of additional points to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 Surveillance data should be regularly reviewed and include a method for evaluating the quality of the data. At the very least, surveillance should provide information for: \u203a\u203a Describing the status of infections associated with health care (that is, incidence and/or prevalence, type, aetiology, severity, attributable burden of disease). \u203a\u203a Identification of high-risk populations, procedures and exposures. \u203a\u203a Detection of outbreaks. \u203a\u203a Assessment of the impact of interventions. \u2022 Different surveillance strategies could include the use of prevalence or incidence studies (for example, site-oriented surveillance, department-oriented surveillance or priority- oriented surveillance) and sentinel surveillance. Most systems select some relevant infections for surveillance and currently the surveillance of all infections (\u201ctotal surveillance\u201d) is rarely done. There should be a process for deciding surveillance priorities. In general, the HAIs selected for surveillance purposes include those that are preventable, especially: \u203a\u203a Infections that may become epidemic in health care facilities. \u203a\u203a Infections in vulnerable populations, such as neonates, burn patients, patients in ICUs and immunocompromised hosts. \u203a\u203a Infections that may cause severe outcomes, such as high case fatality, and infections caused by multidrug- resistant pathogens. \u203a\u203a Infections associated with selected invasive devices or specific procedures, such as the use of intravascular devices, indwelling urinary catheters and surgery, among others. \u203a\u203a Infections that may affect health care workers in clinical, laboratory and other settings. \u2022 It is important to triangulate infection prevention and control data with Water sanitation and hygiene monitoring and services in an effort to help identify the source of the problem (that is, infrastructure, behaviour or both). \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group recognised that public reporting is used in some settings and it is believed to help in transparency and data sharing. Experience from the United States of America using public reporting of health care-associated infection surveillance demonstrates a significant reduction in central line-associated bloodstream infections rates 13-18 months after the introduction of federal policy within states (105) . However, the applicability outside of United States of America is unknown. In addition, the role of legislation for public reporting will need to be taken into account. The manner in which this is undertaken should be aligned with the health system and the maturity of the surveillance systems. Standardization and quality control, including the validity of the data being reported, are a matter of concern and external auditing should be implemented to ensure these. Public reporting can be a positive means to transparently inform patients and the community about important indicators of quality of care and to motivate them to participate in quality improvement initiatives. However, inappropriate or wrong interpretation or exploitation of the data can be serious risks. ",
                "23": "The Guidelines Development Group emphasized the importance of disseminating surveillance reports not only at the national level, but also regionally and locally. All relevant stakeholders should receive these reports in order to help guide, inform and evaluate infection prevention and control interventions for behaviour change, with the ultimate aim to reduce the risk of health care-associated infection and combat antimicrobial resistance.

",
                "25": "Background Over the last decade, infection prevention and control research and field implementation clearly demonstrated that behavioural change and reduction of health care-associated infection are best achieved by applying several interventions/ approaches integrated within multimodal strategies. At its core, a multimodal implementation approach/strategy supports the translation of guideline recommendations into practice within health care with a view to changing health care worker behaviour. It is widely accepted that focusing on only one approach to ensure infection prevention will not achieve or sustain behaviour change. For example, in the past, the process of surveillance alone was considered the approach to employ. In 2006, World Health Organization developed a multimodal improvement strategy to provide users of the World Health Organization Guidelines on hand hygiene in health care (35) with a ready-to-go approach to translate recommendations into practice at the facility level. This strategy was based on the best available scientific evidence and underpinned by both the long-standing expertise of the University of Geneva Hospitals (Switzerland) to promote multimodal hand hygiene promotion campaigns (121) and learning from the England and Wales National Patient Safety Agency cleanyourhands campaign. World Health Organization\u2019s implementation strategy was specifically informed by the literature on implementation science, behavioural change, spread methodology, diffusion of innovation and impact evaluation. The strategy was designed to be adaptable, based on local assessments and available resources, but without jeopardizing its initial structure that intended it to be used with tailored approaches in both facilities starting a hand hygiene campaign for the first time and those with existing action on hand hygiene. The five components are: system change (focused on hand hygiene facilities at the point of patient care); training and education of health care professionals; monitoring of practices and performance feedback; reminders in the workplace; and the creation and maintenance of a safety culture with the participation of both individual health care workers, senior hospital managers and others, including patients, as appropriate. World Health Organization\u2019s Guide to implementation (122) details the actions and resources necessary to ensure that each component of the multimodal strategy can become assimilated into existing infection control and quality/safety programmes. It also describes a clear need for action planning in sequential steps in order to ensure success, highlighting that the implementation of such a strategy requires commitment over a period of five 5 years (minimum). Multimodal strategies, particularly those recommended by World Health Organization, have been subsequently tested in a range of settings around the world. Evaluation of these strategies has demonstrated that specific aspects contributed directly to local success. Moreover, a recent review and meta-analysis related to the multimodal hand hygiene improvement strategy showed that indeed it is the most effective approach to achieve an increase in compliance and a clinically important reduction of health care-associated infection (123) . While the bundle approach has also become both common and successful in recent years, it is important to note the differences in the definitions given here and that multimodal strategies often comprise evidence-based bundles. Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix I) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was the implementation of infection prevention and control activities using multimodal strategies. The primary outcome was the impact on health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of 44 studies comprising 13 non-controlled before- after (44, 60, 121, 124-133) , eight non-controlled cohort trials (134-141) , 10 interrupted time series (40, 48, 50, 52, 95, 142- 146) , four qualitative (54, 120, 147, 148) , three  RCTs (149-151) , two controlled before-after (58, 152) , two mixed methods (61, 153) , one non-controlled interrupted time series (154) and one stepped wedge (155) were included. Forty studies were from high-income countries (40, 48, 50, 54, 60, 61, 95, 120, 121, 124-130, 132-155) , two from one upper-middle-income country (52, 58) and one from a LMIC (131) . In 27 studies, multimodal strategies showed an improvement in hand hygiene compliance among health care workers (44, 50, 54, 58, 61, 121, 125-128, 130-133, 135, 137, 138, 140, 142- 144, 146, 149-153, 155) . Leveraging leadership commitment and the use of opinion leaders and champions were critical components in some multimodal strategies (125, 128, 143, 147, 150, 152, 155) . Four studies used positive reinforcement to health care workers when correctly performing hand hygiene as one element of their strategies (142, 151) by applying principles of product marketing to encourage staff to choose their own intervention (130) and offering financial incentives to hospital units or wards for high-level hand hygiene performance (146) . Accessibility to handrub, role models, a personal sense of responsibility and emotional involvement were some factors identified as barriers affecting hand hygiene compliance (54) . Nine studies investigated the role and effectiveness of multimodal strategies in reducing catheter-related and central line-associated bloodstream infection. Eight were quantitative studies conducted in intensive care (48, 60, 129, 134, 139, 141, 145, 154) and one was a qualitative study ",
                "26": "reporting factors influencing behavioural change in the context of peripheral venous line use (147) . All intervention studies used a multimodal approach, including the use of bundles or comprehensive procedures, defined and promoted at various levels. These were senior manager commitment and support, training, identification of champions or leads and the provision of additional materials and equipment. Three studies focused primarily on catheter insertion (129, 139, 154) , 3 addressed catheter insertion and maintenance (134, 145) , and one focused on catheter care (60) . All 8 quantitative studies showed a reduction in central line- associated bloodstream infection rates (48, 60, 129, 134, 139, 141, 145, 154) . Four studies also provided data about process indicators (60, 128, 141, 154) . Three studies addressed ventilator-associated pneumonia. They showed that multimodal prevention strategies are successful in reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia rates (52, 128, 156) , in particular when the programme is developed by a multidisciplinary task force, processes are closely monitored (124) , all relevant stakeholders are engaged using a well-structured business plan (128) and with the inclusion of a strong educational component for frontline health care workers (52) . In three studies, multimodal strategies were associated with overall reductions in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (95, 136) and C. difficile (40) infections. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection rates were reduced by the use of bundle-based strategies (95, 136) . Among the latter, one used the principles of positive deviance to achieve culture change, making infection control the responsibility of every stakeholder in addition to introducing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus managers at every hospital, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening, contact precautions and promotion of hand hygiene among health care workers (136) . Almost all included studies (42) were performed in high- income/upper-middle-income countries only. The Guidelines Development Group considered the overall quality of the evidence as low given the medium to high risk of bias across studies and the varied study designs outside the recommended Effective practice and organisation of care study designs (9) . Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies An additional 91 studies comprising 69 non-controlled before- after (47, 75, 157-223) , 21 non-controlled cohort trials (224- 244) and one case-control study (245) ] were retrieved  (web Appendix I). Although they did not meet the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria (9) , they provide further support for implementing infection prevention and control activities using multimodal strategies as described above. In 27 studies, multimodal strategies were shown to help improve hand hygiene compliance (47, 75, 158, 161-163, 165, 167, 177, 178, 180, 183, 185, 187, 191, 195, 196, 198, 199, 206, 207, 209, 211, 213, 220, 232, 245) . Multimodal strategies catalysing education, system change, surveillance and feedback were associated with reductions in catheter-related bloodstream infection (159, 170, 216, 239) , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (111, 180, 202, 212) , catheter-associated urinary tract infection (178, 183, 199, 203, 223) , ventilator-associated pneumonia (188, 218, 231, 235) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (190, 217, 219) rates. In one study, a practice development framework (multidisciplinary team, clinical assessments, practice checklists, guideline development and education) was associated with a decrease in catheter- related bloodstream infection (222) . Bundles used as stand-alone interventions or as part of multimodal strategies were associated with decreased rates of central line-associated bloodstream infection (164, 169, 172, 176, 181, 182, 189, 201, 204, 226, 228, 229, 233, 234, 241, 242) , VAP (157, 160, 164, 171, 194, 197, 200, 214, 237, 238, 240) , surgical site infections (179, 224, 243) , catheter-associated urinary tract infection (166, 174) , catheter-related bloodstream infection (208) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (168) . Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that health care providers, health care workers, policy-makers and patients in all settings are likely to place a high value on multimodal strategies that have the potential to reduce health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance and, importantly, improve patient outcome and protect the health workforce. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources required are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation. However, the Guidelines Development Group recognizes that some resource implications depend on the multimodal strategy and the target population involved. Resources may be needed from multiple sources to implement a multimodal strategy, requiring coordination and teamwork across the organization or health facilities. Moreover, technical expertise is required for overall coordination and programme development, which may pose some difficulties in low- and middle-income countries. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation with the potential for adaptation to the local context can be accomplished in all countries, while acknowledging that the presence of an infection prevention and control programme should be taken into consideration prior to implementing multimodal strategies, ",

Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group discussed the need for further research to determine which elements of multimodal strategies are most effective and what other elements should be considered in addition to the recognized 5 components. Furthermore, the panel expressed that better quality studies will be needed when investigating components of multimodal strategies and their impact on HAIs. Stepped-wedge cluster randomized studies could represent the most appropriate methodological approach to answer this question. It would also be interesting to better understand the type of (multi-)professional expertise necessary for implementing successful multimodal strategies and to identify the key staff members driving these interventions, depending on the setting. Qualitative research to understand the factors facilitating success and the barriers and challenges to implementation is also considered to be of the utmost importance, given the complex implementation of these interventions. Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined the following additional point to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group noted that although the reviewed evidence was not sufficiently high quality, patient involvement could be considered as a part of establishing or strengthening the safety climate in the context of multimodal strategies. However, this approach requires local adaptation and careful consideration of the cultural specificities, social dynamics, level of education and literacy. It was emphasized that it is essential that this component involve also care attendants and family members as they often contribute to care delivery in some settings. ",

As a result, the Guidelines Development Group decided to recommend that infection prevention and control activities should be implemented under the coordination and facilitation by the national infection prevention and control programme using multimodal strategies in an effort to improve care practices and reduce health care-associated infection and combat antimicrobial resistance. The overall quality of the evidence was low given the medium to high risk of bias across studies.

This recommendation is to support facility level improvement. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group did remark that not all infection prevention and control interventions require multimodal strategies and, in some cases, more targeted, direct approaches for improvement are needed.

                "29": "to broader safety and quality improvement. In addition, a number of countries have implemented the World Health Organization Core components document (2009), which in itself represents a multifaceted approach to improvement. There have been important lessons learned on the role of national level support for the implementation of such multifaceted interventions. Many countries have also initiated patient safety programmes nationally within which infection prevention and control core components have been included, as evidenced in this review (246-248) . Other examples include Australia\u2019s development of a national hand hygiene initiative and national safety and quality health service standards (hospital accreditation standards) (249) . Parallels from national and sub-national hand hygiene campaigns can also yield insights into the factors for success and sustainability. In particular, a number of studies in this area recognized the need for financial and human resources as predominant reasons for successful nationally- coordinated approaches. The use of care bundles has also become common in recent years as part of national evidence-based improvement programmes. However, as already noted, bundles have been recognized as only one component of a multimodal strategy. Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix II) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was the implementation of infection prevention and control activities using multimodal strategies. The primary outcome was the impact on health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of 14 national or subnational studies comprising seven interrupted time series (136, 248, 250-254) , four controlled before-after (133, 255-257) , two RCTs (151, 258) and one non-randomized controlled trial (259) ] were included, all from high-income countries (133, 136, 151, 248, 250-259) . The elements within the national multimodal strategies varied, but they were evaluated as a collective whole. The number of elements ranged from two to eight with the most frequently cited elements being the implementation of a care bundle with the provision of training and campaign materials to support the implementation (133, 136, 151, 250, 251, 255-259) . Three studies investigated the effectiveness of multimodal strategies in reducing central line-associated bloodstream infection and showed a reduction in infection rates post- intervention (250, 258, 259) . In all studies, the introduction of a central line-associated bloodstream infection care bundle (250, 258, 259) was accompanied by other components, including targeted training and supportive materials (250, 258, 259) , organizational culture change and executive support (258, 259) , surveillance (259) , posters and other promotional campaign materials (250) . Conversely, in one study measuring the impact of a state-wide surgical site infections multimodal strategy, no improved surgical outcomes were observed during the study period (256) . In three studies, a significant reduction in infection rates was observed following the introduction of a central line- associated bloodstream infection care bundle only, targeting insertion and maintenance care practices in paediatric ICUs (252-254) . In one study, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections decreased during the intervention period for the surgical site infections care bundle for both orthopaedic and cardiac operations (248) . One study evaluated the effectiveness of a collaborative quality improvement strategy on health care-associated infection in neonatal ICUs in the United States of America (257) . The interventions focused on the prevention of central line-associated bloodstream infection by introducing a care bundle, targeted training and additional complementary training materials. After risk adjustment, the quality improvement strategy was significantly associated with a reduction in health care-associated infection (positive blood cerebrospinal fluid culture) for the evaluation period (257) . In one study, a state-wide multimodal programme that showed reductions in catheter-related bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia using a care bundle comprising elements for cultural change, training and teamwork and communication was investigated for its impact on mortality and length of stay (255) . Reductions in mortality were associated with the implementation of the multimodal programme at both 1 and 2 years\u2019 post-implementation. However, no significant difference for adjusted length of stay was observed between groups (255) . Two studies explored the effect of a national multimodal infection prevention and control programme to reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (136, 251) infections. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization or infection declined with the implementation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening, culture change, training and funding (136) . A significant downward trend in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia rates was associated with the implementation of a recent national multimodal infection prevention and control programme that used improved provision of alcohol-based handrubs, performance feedback to health care workers, posters and other campaign materials and policy reviews (251) . Implementation of national multimodal programmes on hand hygiene practices led to mixed results. In one Australian study, both compliance and health care-associated infection rates were measured after the implementation of a state-wide hand hygiene campaign ",
                "30": "based on the improved provision of  alcohol-based handrubs, posters and other campaign materials and identified leads. The results showed a significant impact on two out of four clinical indicators of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, but the authors recognized that these might have been also influenced by other infection prevention and control interventions (133) . Conversely, in a national multimodal hand hygiene programme using targeted training and other supportive materials, improved provision of alcohol-based handrub and performance feedback to health care workers, there was an estimated average change in \u2018any hand hygiene compliance\u2019 in intervention hospitals when compared to control hospitals (151) . The Guidelines Development Group agreed to consider the overall quality of evidence as low given the medium to high risk of bias across studies. However, the group unanimously decided that this remains a strong recommendation. All studies (14) were performed in high-income countries only and, therefore, generalizability is uncertain or limited with regards to applicability outside of these settings. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies An additional 48 studies comprising 33 non-controlled before-after (158, 175, 183, 231, 239, 247, 260-285) , 14 non- controlled cohort trials (31, 284, 286-296) and one qualitative study (297) ] were retrieved (web Appendix II). Although these provide further support for implementing national level infection prevention and control activities using multimodal strategies and care bundles, the studies are not included in the overall analysis as they did not meet the study design types recommended by the Effective practice and organisation of care group (9) . In five studies, multimodal strategies were shown to help improve hand hygiene compliance (158, 261-263, 273, 283) . Bundles used as stand-alone interventions or as part of a multimodal strategy were associated with decreased rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (231, 268, 274-277, 284, 288, 296) , central line-associated bloodstream infection (265-267, 280, 281, 285, 287, 293, 298) , surgical site infections (31, 264, 279, 292, 295) , catheter-related bloodstream infection (239, 270-272) , bloodstream infection (247, 260) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (183, 294) When paired with a broader safety programme initiative including care practice checklists, education tools promoting increased communication, teamwork and feedback of data, a decrease in central-line days (282) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (287) was observed.  In one study, a hand hygiene initiative in conjunction with education and feedback across 6 states was associated with a decrease in bloodstream infection rates in four states (260) . In four studies, reductions in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission and infections were associated with the introduction of a quality improvement methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prevention programme (289, 291) , a cleanyourhands campaign (278) and a national infection prevention and control programme including national guidelines and regulations, training programmes and national level surveillance (31) . The implementation of a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae preventative programme was associated with a decrease in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae prevalence and increased compliance with infection prevention and control standards (286) . A pronounced downward trend of C. difficile incidence rates was observed with the use of standardized clinical infection prevention and environmental cleaning protocols, including monitoring with checklists (290) . Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the typical values and preferences of health care providers, policy- makers and patients regarding the outcome would favour this intervention. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources required are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation. However, the Guidelines Development Group recognizes that the resources to action this recommendation (that is, human resources, infection prevention and control expertise, the expertise of social scientists, support services, tools and budgets, and leadership commitment) may be a challenge in some low- and middle-income countries. In some instances, partnerships or collaborations could assist in the achievement of programme delivery and funding, such as the World Health Organization African Partnerships for Patient Safety model. One cost-effectiveness study estimated the cost of a central line-associated bloodstream infection at US$ 18 793 per patient, while the cost of the quality improvement programme was approximately US$ 540 per patient (299) . Another study estimated a cumulative saving of 509 000 C. difficile infection cases and 82 000 C. difficile -attributable deaths averted with cost-savings of US$ 2.5 billion (US$ 1.2-4 billion) through the implementation of a multifaceted C. difficile infection prevention and control programme (300) . Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be accomplished in all countries, acknowledging that the presence of an infection prevention and control programme should be taken into ",

Conclusions The Guidelines Development Group recognized that the evidence is of low quality, but it decided that this should be a strong recommendation. The purpose of the recommendation is to support facility- level improvements by ensuring that national level support and coordination is in place. The Guidelines Development Group also believed that the national approach should be within the context of national infection prevention and control programmes and could be considered as part of a wider quality improvement agenda. Therefore, the Guidelines Development Group recommended that national infection prevention and control programmes should coordinate and facilitate the implementation of infection prevention and control activities through multimodal strategies on a nationwide or sub-national level to improve practices and reduce HAIs and antimicrobial resistance spread. Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group discussed the need for further research on what is required to facilitate sustainable national implementation and roll-out. Research into the impact of culture and context in relation to national approaches to multimodal strategies were also highlighted. In addition, well-designed cost-effectiveness studies, together with impact evaluation studies, were recommended. Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined the following additional points to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group was of the opinion that information technology and data management support will be critical to the central coordination of national multimodal strategies, especially for assisting the regular reporting and evaluation of the strategies and infection prevention and control programmes. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group noted that it was not possible to always separate the difference between the impact of care bundles and multimodal approaches. Therefore, it was suggested that care bundles could be embedded in multimodal strategies, when appropriate. ",

It is important to note that this quality improvement process should be done in a blame-free manner to promote a non-punitive institutional culture. In addition, how these results and findings are communicated and shared are equally important to the process itself. Regular monitoring, evaluation and reporting of infection prevention and control outcomes and care practices should be shared with the immediate stakeholders, but also those in higher positions who have the ability to act and support change across the organization. Understanding the role of auditing and feedback and its impact on health care-associated infection remains unclear, but it is extremely important. Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix II) was to evaluate the effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes. One component identified was the audit of infection prevention and control practices and timely feedback to all relevant staff at the facility level. The primary outcomes were health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of six studies comprising one randomized controlled trial (302) , two controlled before-after (303, 304) , one interrupted time series (95) and two non-controlled before-after (305, 306) were included. Five were from high-income countries (95, 302, 304-306) and one from an upper-middle-income country (303) . Daily audits of adherence to bundle strategies coupled with regular feedback have been shown to reduce rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (305) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition (95) . Predefined process indicators for catheter insertion improved with periodic auditing and personalized feedback (302) . Peer assessments with anonymous feedback effectively improved universal precaution measures (303) and the use of a comprehensive checklist covering a wide range of care practices reduced the prevalence of all health care-associated infection (304) . Furthermore, cases of bacteraemia caused by coagulase- negative staphylococci were reduced by internal audits on hand hygiene and catheter-hub care in neonates (306) . The Guidelines Development Group considered the evidence as low quality given the medium to high risk of bias across studies according to the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria (9) and the varied study designs. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies Only one additional study [non-controlled before-after trial (307) ] not meeting the Effective practice and organisation of care study design criteria was retrieved  (web Appendix II) and provided further support for periodic audits and timely feedback of infection prevention and control practices. In this study, Armellino and colleagues demonstrated that remote video auditing and feedback (visual cues and electronic reports) were associated with a significant increase in hand hygiene compliance compared to remote video auditing alone. Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the typical values and preferences of patients regarding the outcome would favour a regular evaluation of infection prevention and control practices in an effort to gauge implementation and, subsequently, support future improvement in the quality of care provided. In addition, health care providers, policy-makers and the health workforce are likely to place a high value on routine monitoring and feedback as part of a multifaceted infection prevention and control programme. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources necessary are worth the expected net benefit from following this recommendation. However, the Guidelines Development Group recognizes that the auditing process will require dedicated time and additional human resources in order to achieve meaningful, accurate evaluation of infection prevention and control practices in some cases. Reliable auditing requires also the specific and appropriate training of assessors. This expertise is usually limited or unavailable in low-resource settings, but it is essential to offer this training in order to collect reliable data. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be accomplished in all countries, although further education regarding audits may be required to help standardize this process. Moreover, the panel acknowledged that the auditing process should be undertaken with care and sensitivity, promoting a non-punitive, blame-free environment. A good approach to start auditing activities is crucial for the future success of the programme. For each facility, the approach should be adapted to the existing situation and context. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable.

Despite the limited evidence, the Guidelines Development Group agreed that monitoring and evaluation should be an activity driven and coordinated by the national infection prevention and control programme and that this would be a strong recommendation based on a moderate quality of evidence. The panel also proposed that hand hygiene be considered as a key indicator for all national infection prevention and control programmes. Remarks \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group recognized that monitoring and evaluation provides a systematic method to document the impact of national programmes in terms of defined indicators, for example, tracking hand hygiene improvement as a key indicator, including hand hygiene compliance monitoring. The Guidelines Development Group felt strongly that the regular monitoring, evaluation and reporting of infection prevention and control outcomes, processes and strategies should occur at the national level and within health care facilities. Monitoring and evaluation should be performed to assess the extent to which standards are being met, goals accomplished and activities performed according to requirements and to identify aspects that may need improvement. This includes regular evaluation of compliance with regulations, as well as compliance with clinical practice standards. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group supported the recommended approach to national level monitoring and evaluation as described in the World Health Organization Core components document (2009), which highlighted having in place mechanisms that: \u2022 Provide regular reports on the state of national goals (outcomes and processes) and strategies. \u2022 Regularly monitor and evaluate the Water sanitation and hygiene services, infection prevention and control activities and structure of the health care facilities through audits or other officially recognized means. \u2022 Promote the evaluation of the performance of local infection prevention and control programmes in a non- punitive institutional culture.

                "36": "component identified was establishing monitoring and feedback systems at the national level. The primary outcome was hand hygiene compliance or any other process or infrastructure indicators. One randomized controlled trial (149) exploring the effectiveness of providing feedback of national hand hygiene compliance data in acute care settings for elderly patients and in ICUs (149) was identified. In this study, Fuller and colleagues tested the hypothesis that a behavioural designed feedback intervention would produce a significant sustained improvement in hand hygiene compliance compared to routine practice (149) . Feedback was provided to individual health care workers whose hand hygiene practices had been observed at ward meetings. The study found that the odds ratio for hand hygiene compliance was higher in both of the acute care (of the elderly) wards as a result of providing feedback on hand hygiene behaviour (149) . This study was evaluated with an overall low risk of bias. The Guidelines Development Group considered the overall evidence from this study as moderate quality. Non-Effective practice and organisation of care studies One additional study was retrieved [non-controlled before- after trial (308) ] that supports the inclusion of hand hygiene as a key indicator for monitoring and providing timely feedback. McGuckin and colleagues investigated the impact of a 12-month multicentre collaboration assessing hand hygiene compliance monitoring of product usage in health care facilities in the United States of America combined with feedback about hand hygiene compliance. A significant increase in hand hygiene compliance was observed from 26% for ICUs and 36% for non-ICUs to 37% and 51%, respectively (308) . Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this intervention. The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the typical values and preferences of patients regarding the outcome would favour a national hand hygiene monitoring programme that included shared feedback to help drive improvements at the national, district and local level. It is highly likely that policy-makers and health providers will place a high value on national approaches to monitoring and evaluation since such an approach has the potential to increase user confidence that infection prevention and control is being taken seriously as a key public health issue. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources are worth the expected net benefit. However, the Guidelines Development Group recognizes that in some instances, the monitoring and personalized feedback of infection prevention and control indicators will require dedicated time and additional human resources in order to achieve a meaningful, accurate evaluation of infection prevention and control practices. Electronic systems to undertake audits, which are becoming increasingly widely available in particular for hand hygiene monitoring and do result in a need for additional resources, are not covered within this chapter. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this can be accomplished in all countries, while acknowledging that the establishment of national monitoring and evaluation systems, including hand hygiene monitoring, requires an in-place and functional national infection prevention and control programme. Further education regarding hand hygiene monitoring may be required to help standardize the process locally and nationally. Moreover, the panel suggested that the monitoring process should be undertaken with care and sensitivity, taking account of patients and promoting a non-punitive, blame-free environment to nurture staff improvement. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable. Conclusions Following careful evaluation, the Guidelines Development Group recommended that a national approach to monitoring and evaluation should be established with a focus on hand hygiene monitoring as a key indicator in the context of a national infection prevention and control programme. Research gaps Despite the numerous examples of existing national approaches to monitoring and evaluation, the Guidelines Development Group remarked that a lack of available published evidence remains, especially high quality data. Critical aspects that need to be explored include the availability of Water sanitation and hygiene services and the impact on infection prevention and control practices other than hand hygiene and other infection prevention and control outcomes, such as the audit mechanism against catheter-related bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infection and other relevant infection standards and interventions reflective of the health facility context. Furthermore, the panel agreed that more innovative methods of monitoring should be explored beyond traditional approaches, for example, electronic and/or infrared. ",
                "37": "Additional implementation considerations The Guidelines Development Group outlined the following additional point to be considered in the implementation of the recommendation. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group acknowledged that monitoring should include a variety of frameworks of which one should be self- or peer- evaluation against national standards or goals. Regarding hand hygiene performance monitoring and feedback, the Guidelines Development Group suggested the use of the World Health Organization hand hygiene self-assessment tool across all facilities as a minimum requirement. The reporting of results should be shared at the national level as a benchmarking approach, as well as at the facility level, including hospital management and senior administration. Ideally, regular hand hygiene compliance monitoring according to the World Health Organization method should also be a requirement mandated by the national infection prevention and control programme, at least for reference hospitals in the country.

                "38": "the following elements should be adhered to in order to reduce the risk of health care-associated infection and the spread of antimicrobial resistance: (1) bed occupancy should not exceed the standard capacity of the facility; (2) health care worker staffing levels should be adequately assigned according to patient workload. (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence) Rationale for the recommendation \u2022 Evaluation of the evidence from 19 studies shows that bed occupancy exceeding the standard capacity of the facility is associated with the increased risk of health care-associated infection in acute care facilities, in addition to inadequate health care worker staffing levels. No meta-analysis was performed due to the different methodologies and the different outcomes measured. The Guidelines Development Group unanimously decided to recommend adherence to bed occupancy not exceeding the standard capacity of the facility and adequate health care worker staffing levels according to patient workload in order to reduce the risk of HAIs and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The overall quality of the evidence was very low, but the Guidelines Development Group unanimously decided that the strength of this recommendation should be strong due to the importance of these topics not only for reducing the risk of health care-associated infection but for improving the quality of health care delivery and achieving quality universal health coverage. Remarks \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group considered the standard for bed occupancy to be one patient per bed and that this should not be exceeded. This is in direct support of the World Health Organization standard on facility design, recommending one patient per bed with adequate spacing (1 metre) between patients (25, 32). \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group acknowledged that intended bed capacity could vary from original designs and across facilities and countries. For these reasons, it was proposed that ward design regarding bed capacity should be adhered to and in accordance with national and international standards. In exceptional circumstances where bed capacity is exceeded, hospital management should act to ensure appropriate staffing levels that meet patient demand and the adequate distance between beds. The Guidelines Development Group considered that these principles apply to all units and departments with inpatient beds, including emergency departments, while the evidence reviewed is related to general wards only. \u2022 Overcrowding was recognized as being a public health issue that can lead to disease transmission.

In addition, it was also noted that patient\u2019s visitors/relatives might assume care activities in some situations. \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group also recognized that in special circumstances, adherence to this recommendation may need to be balanced against the immediate need to provide clinical care to as many patients as possible. Background A combination of factors should be considered when determining the patient-to-bed ratio and the health care worker-to-patient ratio, including patient acuity, health care demand and availability of the health workforce. These factors can raise challenges regarding the intended versus designed hospital bed capacity, which could potentially lead to increased rates of health care-associated infection and spread of antimicrobial resistance if not complemented with an appropriate health care worker staffing level. Overcrowding in health care facilities is recognized as being a public health issue that can lead to disease transmission. Understanding these factors and to what extent they influence patient outcomes and impact on health care worker practices will be important in creating an enabling environment for the delivery of safe, high quality and people-centred care.

                "39": "Summary of the evidence The purpose of the evidence review (web Appendix I) was to evaluate the impact of appropriate bed occupancy standards and the balance of health care worker staffing to patient workload on health care-associated infection and hand hygiene compliance. A total of 19 studies comprising 12 non-controlled cohort (310-321), three case-control studies (322-324), one interrupted time series (325), one non-controlled interrupted time series (326), one mixed methods (327) and one cross- sectional (328) trial were retrieved through the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) and none through its update. Studies were all from high- income countries. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission and infection were associated with bed occupancy in six studies (312-315, 325, 329) and the nurse-to-patient ratio in seven studies (311, 318, 321-323, 326, 327). Three studies reported that increases in nurse-to-patient ratios resulted in reduced health care-associated infection (316, 317, 319), while inadequate adherence to hand hygiene protocols was associated with low staffing levels in one study and with high workload in another (320, 328). The quality of the evidence was graded as intermediate according to the Integrated quality criteria for review of multiple study designs criteria used in the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) . However, given that most of these publications were not intervention studies and do not meet the Effective practice and organisation of care recommended study designs criteria (9) , the Guidelines Development Group considered this evidence as very low quality. Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was found on patient values and preferences with regards to this recommendation. The Guidelines Development Group agreed that patients in all settings are likely to place a high value on both adequate staffing levels and the ability to access a bed in order to reduce their risk of health care-associated infection and of antimicrobial resistance acquisition and would support this recommendation to ensure safe care. However, the Guidelines Development Group did recognize that in some settings, adherence to this recommendation might be influenced by patient opinion. Patients may feel that they would still like to receive care in an overcrowded facility if this is the only option available. While understanding that such situations can exist, populations should be aware that this is unacceptable from a safety perspective. In addition, it does not support quality in the context of universal health coverage and violates a basic human right. Furthermore, policy-makers, health care providers and the health workforce are likely to place a high value on having sufficient capacity and an infrastructure that facilitates safe service delivery. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation can be implemented in all countries in the long term and that the resources required will be worth the net benefit, despite the costs incurred. There is a need for institutions to provide the necessary resources in order to meet these recommendations in the short and long term, including government commitment to quality health service delivery in the context of universal health coverage, while recognizing the time required to action such changes. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group believes that this recommendation is feasible in most circumstances. However, in extreme cases, adherence to this recommendation may not be possible and facilities should find interim solutions in order to provide the safest care possible. Moreover, implementing a national plan for human resource development will be highly beneficial for the successful implementation of this core component. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find the recommendation acceptable. Conclusions Following careful evaluation of the evidence, the panel recommended that all facilities should (1) not exceed standard bed occupancy capacity, and (2) ensure that health care worker staffing levels are appropriate to patient workload in order to reduce the risk of health care-associated infection and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Research gaps Considering the evidence reviewed, the Guidelines Development Group noted that additional research is needed on the impact of patient- to-bed ratio on health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance spread, including cost- effectiveness, with an emphasis on multiple bed occupancy in adult, paediatric and neonatal populations. The panel felt that this should be extended to include the examination of overcrowding in emergency departments with respect to the acute risk of disease transmission as a public health concern. The Guidelines Development Group identified also an overall lack of understanding on the role of visitors/relatives as patient care attendants and their impact on workload, workflow and health care-associated infection, as well as the spread of antimicrobial resistance, and further research is needed on this topic. Further investigation regarding health care worker workload during outbreaks should also be considered. Finally, the identification of nursing activity scores for workload would be useful, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. ",

                "41": "Background Safe, effective performance in the delivery of day-to-day patient care and treatment is crucial for optimal outcomes both for patients and health care workers\u2019 health and safety. In an effort to promote effective and standardized clinical practice in accordance with accepted guidelines, emphasis should be placed on optimizing the health care environment to ensure a work system that\u00a0 supports the effective implementation of infection prevention and control practices. Ensuring the provision of adequate water and sanitation services of appropriate materials, items and equipment and their exact placement or position are recognised as critical elements of human factors engineering (ergonomics), which support their appropriate use and increases compliance with good practices. Ultimately, this contributes to effective implementation and the attainment of the desired behaviour supporting infection prevention and control. Several environmental issues are of concern for infection prevention and control. The most relevant are those that deal with some features of the building design and Water sanitation and hygiene-related conditions in the health care facility. We outline here the most relevant elements for a safe environment supporting appropriate infection prevention and control practices according to expert consensus. Based on the available evidence, section 8b includes a specific recommendation proposed by the Guidelines Development Group on hand hygiene facilities. Health facility infrastructure and Water sanitation and hygiene An appropriate infrastructure including the health care facility building and the availability of safe water and sanitation facilities according to international and national standards (32) are essential requirements. In the absence of such facilities, infection prevention and control cannot be effectively implemented and health care worker, patient and visitor safety are put at great risk. infection prevention and control teams should be involved in the design, construction and commissioning of any new or upgraded building from the early stages . Equally important is the engagement of the infection prevention and control team when major renovation or demolition work is being planned as these situations can represent a risk to patient safety through the heavy release of fungi into the air. The following points highlight the infection prevention and control requirements for water supply and sanitation in a well-designed, safe health facility: \u2022 Adequate and continuous supply (quantity, quality and access) of safe water: \u203a\u203a 5-400 litres per person per day (outpatient services require less water, while operating and delivery rooms require more water) (32) . \u203a\u203a Safe water should be available in all treatment wards and in waiting areas. \u203a\u203a Water should be available for drinking in compliance with World Health Organization Guidelines for drinking water (334) , hand washing for food preparation, personal hygiene, medical activities, cleaning and laundry.  This includes water for bathing, which is necessary before surgery and for general hygiene and the dignity/respect of patients. \u2022 Water-associated infectious risks, such as legionellosis, should be appropriately managed. \u2022 Adequate sanitary facilities should be in place in all health care facilities (32): \u203a\u203a At least one toilet for every 20 users for an inpatient setting. \u203a\u203a Toilets should be built according to technical specifications to ensure that excreta are safely managed. \u203a\u203a Sanitation quality should be appropriate, safe, clean and accessible to all users, including those with reduced mobility A reliable water point with soap should be available in all treatment areas and waiting rooms, and close to toilets for patients and staff to wash their hands. \u203a\u203a dedicated clean storage area for patient care items and equipment, including sterile material, and a separate area for the storage of clean linen as outlined in the PAHO/World Health Organization manual on Decontamination and reprocessing of medical devices for health-care facilities (2016) (332) ; \u203a\u203a adequate facilities for safe disposal of health care waste including safe use and disposal of sharps; \u203a\u203a risk assessment system and measures for patient and their families and staff protection during building and renovation work (333) , especially in high-risk areas such as: Units where severely immunocompromised patients (transplant, patients with profound neutropenia etc.) are managed Intensive care, neonatal and burn units; \u203a\u203a operating rooms \u2022 The Guidelines Development Group emphasized the need for infection preventionists to be involved in planning all these activities and systems and in the design of buildings and infrastructures in health care facilities. * Negative pressure ventilation conditions may be necessary to prevent transmission, for example, infections with multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis . ** If the number of isolation rooms is insufficient, patients with the same infection/multidrug-resistant organism (for example, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may share the same bay, based on risk assessment evaluation by the infection prevention and control team. ",
                "42": "Faecal waste should be safely managed either through on-site facilities or off-site through disposal into a functioning sewer or other safe removal and eventual treatment means. \u2022 Sufficient energy should be available to pump water, power health care waste destruction technologies and provide lighting for toilets. Key building features for appropriate infection prevention and control \u2022 Adequate ventilation should be in place for isolation rooms. \u2022 Adequate facilities required for the isolation of patients requiring contact and airborne precautions (see below for further details). \u2022 The facility should be built in a way so that traffic flow can be regulated to minimize exposure of high-risk patients and to facilitate patient transport. \u2022 Precautions to control rodents, insects and other vectors of disease should be in place, including use of screens and bed nets to protect against mosquitoes. \u2022 Appropriate facilities (for example, sluice area, bedpans, urinals, etc.) in place for waste management (see below for further details). In particular, it is essential that the floor space be adequate between beds for activities to take place and to avoid cross- contamination between adjacent bed spaces (32) . The exact floor/bed space is influenced by the type of health care facility, staff activity and type of patient. Ergonomic studies have established that most activities carried out at the bedside can be accommodated within the dimensions 3600 mm (width) \u00d7 3700 mm (depth). This represents the clear bed space and does not include space for fixed storage, preparation and worktops (335) . The bed space (2.5 metres between beds) for critical care areas needs to be greater for reasons of circulation space and the equipment used in these areas. World Health Organization considers the standard for bed occupancy to be one patient per bed and that this should not be exceeded. This is in direct support of the World Health Organization standard on facility design, recommending one patient per bed with adequate spacing (1 metre between beds) between patients. As a part of good practice and to prevent cross-infection, World Health Organization recommends that bed-sharing be avoided. Personal protective equipment Medical non-sterile and surgical sterile gloves, surgical masks, goggles or face shields and gowns are considered as essential personal protective equipment. Respirators and aprons should also be available in adequate quantities in all facilities for use when necessary. All personal protective equipment should be: \u2022 Available, good quality, close to the point of use and readily accessible. \u2022 Stored in a clean/dry area to prevent contamination until required for use. \u2022 Preferably single use. For reusable items/equipment, there must be a clear policy and standard operating procedure for placement and decontamination. A standardized operating procedure and management system should be in place for stock ordering and rotation to ensure that there is always an adequate supply based on usage and that older items are always used first. Decontamination of items, equipment and medical devices Sterilization or decontamination of items, equipment and medical devices is a complex and highly specialized subject. All patient care surfaces, medical devices and equipment used in health care have the potential to become contaminated with microorganisms. Once contaminated, these items can pose a risk to patients, staff and visitors. As an essential component of infection prevention and control strategies, all health care facilities should implement a standardized operating procedure for the safe and effective decontamination of high-touch patient care areas and all reusable items/equipment to prevent cross- infection. It is essential that facilities have a dedicated area for the decontamination of reusable items/equipment. Depending on their complexity and activities, health care facilities should also provide high-quality and efficient sterilization of clinical materials that are considered critical according to the Spaulding classification (336). This includes sufficient and reliable energy to power sterilization devices. Staff working in decontamination units and the sterile services department must receive adequate training (with regular updates). The building design of the decontamination unit and sterile services department must meet international standards (332) . Isolation capacity Isolation involves the creation of a barrier to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and multidrug-resistant organisms from one patient to another and to health care workers, carers and visitors. To achieve effective isolation, designated single rooms (preferably with private toilet and shower facilities) should be available to place suspected or confirmed infectious patients. Therefore, the structure of the environment must support effective isolation according to the following principles: \u2022 Patients should be informed about their infection in a clear and understandable way and reminded how to prevent spread to others. \u2022 Items used by patients during isolation should not be shared between patients. ",
                "43": "Personal protective equipment should be changed following direct contact with patients, even if being cared for in the same isolation area with the same communicable disease. \u2022 Hand hygiene should be performed at all times when needed according to the World Health Organization recommendations and the \u201c5 moments for hand hygiene\u201d approach. \u2022 Patient transport and movement to other wards/ department should be restricted or limited, unless medically necessary. For children in isolation, only plastic toys can be allowed so that they can be cleaned and disinfected after use before being shared with any other children. Visitors should be restricted and information should be provided on the danger of infection. Requirements for hand hygiene should be emphasized and appropriate personal protective equipment should be provided based on the mode of transmission of infections. Waste management structures and processes Adherence to established environmental standards should be observed in all waste management activities and compliance with national/international policies on waste, environmental health and vector control. Health care waste management is a process that includes all activities involving waste generation, waste minimization, avoidance, segregation, collection, transportation, storage, treatment and final disposal or recycling and reuse for all waste types generated (337) . Appropriate segregation of waste at the point of generation, including sharps, and the collection and adequate disposal of waste are essential to prevent the spread of infection to patients, staff and visitors. Guidelines and local standardized operating procedure on regular collection and disposal are essential to keep the environment clean and safe and reduce odours and attraction for animals. Improper disposal of infectious health care facility waste may also pose a risk of infection to the community at large. Procurement and use of single-use devices and safety- engineered injection devices Procurement and distribution of sufficient quantities of good quality single-use devices is a necessary prerequisite to avoid unsafe practices of reuse of medical devices. Therefore, a supply management system based on needs should support continuous procurement of single use devices. Regarding injection devices, all health care facilities should follow World Health Organization guidelines and principles for safe injections and safe sharps\u2019 management. Furthermore, all facilities should procure and use syringes with reuse protection mechanisms and with \u201csharps\u2019 injury protection\u201d (that is, features to protect health care workers from needle-stick injuries). These devices should meet World Health Organization quality standards and be used according to the World Health Organization injection safety global policy (338) . Cleaning of the environment A clean environment plays an important role in the prevention of health care-associated infection and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Many factors, including the design and organization of the health care facility, availability and access to safe water, appropriate sanitation, laundry systems and air quality can significantly influence the transmission of infection. The environment must be thoroughly cleaned by applying the following general principles: \u2022 Cleaning consists of the removal of dust, soil, and contaminants on environmental surfaces and ensures a dry, hygienic and healthy health care facility environment for patients, staff, and visitors. \u2022 Cleaning is an essential step prior to any disinfection process as it removes dirt, debris and other materials, which decrease the effectiveness of chemical disinfectants. \u2022 The use of neutral detergent solutions is essential for effective cleaning. \u2022 Special attention should be given to sanitation or toilet facilities as these are often areas that are heavily contaminated and reservoirs for HAIs. \u2022 Routine bacteriological monitoring to assess the effectiveness of environmental cleaning is not required. Large-surface cleaning methods should be avoided because they produce mists or aerosols or disperse dust in patient- care areas (for example, dry sweeping, spraying or dusting). Airborne fungal spores are especially dangerous as they can cause fatal infections in immunosuppressed patients. ",

                "45": "comprising one randomized controlled trial (339) , four non-controlled before- after (132, 340-342) and one qualitative study (148) were identified. A determinant of hand hygiene compliance was the placement of handrub dispensers at the point of care within the context of a multimodal improvement approach (132, 339, 341, 342) . One additional study supplied \u2018pocket bottles\u2019 of alcohol-based handrub to anaesthesiologists and showed a marked increase in their hand hygiene behaviour (340) . In one qualitative study, it was noted that a source of frustration for health care workers is when there is limited access to hand hygiene facilities (148) . In addition, three studies showed that customized insertion kits for central venous catheters, as well as pre-stocked carts, helped to decrease the rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections (45, 48, 129) . In one study, improved prescribing of isolation measures was associated with the use of electronic reminders for doctors when ordering isolation precautions for patients fulfilling the criteria (343) . All studies were performed in high-income countries only. The studies included in the Systematic review and evidence-based guidance on organization of hospital infection control programmes review (2) were rated as moderate quality evidence according to Integrated quality criteria for review of multiple study designs. However, all but one did not meet the recommended study design types as outlined by the Effective practice and organisation of care criteria (9) . For this reason, the Guidelines Development Group decided that the overall quality of the evidence is very low. Additional factors considered when formulating the recommendation Values and preferences No study was identified on patient values and preferences. However, the Guidelines Development Group is confident that patients in all settings would place a high value on appropriate infrastructures and readily available materials and equipment at the point of care to enhance appropriate hand hygiene and other infection prevention and control practices. Furthermore, policy-makers, health care providers and the health workforce are likely to place a high value on having access to the correct materials and equipment that facilitates hand hygiene within the context of safe service delivery. Resource implications The Guidelines Development Group is confident that the resources required are worth the expected net benefit and that implementing this recommendation is likely to reduce overall health care costs. The expert panel did remark that not all solutions require additional resources and can be low cost, such as the optimal placement of hand hygiene materials that support the workflow of health care workers and their behaviour. To help reduce resource implications, further development of the local production of hand hygiene products should be a priority for implementation of this recommendation in low- and middle-income countries. Feasibility The Guidelines Development Group is confident that this recommendation is feasible and can include low-cost solutions. Acceptability The Guidelines Development Group is confident that key stakeholders are likely to find this recommendation acceptable as hand hygiene is a fundamental clinical practice for all health care workers. Conclusions Based on the available evidence that was mostly focused on hand hygiene, the Guidelines Development Group concluded that ensuring available and appropriate hand hygiene materials and equipment at the point of care with optimal placement will assist in the performance of appropriate hand hygiene practices. Research gaps The Guidelines Development Group identified the need for more research of good quality to evaluate the impact of system change on health care-associated infection and antimicrobial resistance reduction, in addition to change of practices. Furthermore, the implementation of local alcohol-based handrub production should be further investigated, including quality control and acceptance aspects. "

                "1": "M edical emergencies can happen every day, in any setting. People are injured in situations like falls or motor-vehicle accidents, or they develop sudden illnesses, such as heart attack or stroke. The statistics are sobering. For example, about 900,000 people in the United States die each year from some form of heart disease. More than 300,000 of these deaths are caused by sudden cardiac arrest. Heart disease is the number one cause of death in this country. Another leading cause of death is unintentional injury. In 2008, approximately 118,000 Americans died from an unintentional injury and another 25.7 million were disabled. Given the large number of injuries and sudden illnesses that occur in the United States each year, it is possible that you might have to deal with an emergency situation someday. If you do, you should know who and when to call, what care to give and how to give that care until emergency medical help takes over. This chapter discusses your role in the emergency medical services (EMS) system, the purpose of Good Samaritan laws, how to gain consent from an injured or ill person and how to reduce your risk of disease transmission while giving care. In addition, you will read about the emergency action steps, CHECK\u2014CALL\u2014CARE , which guide you on how to check and give emergency care for an injured or suddenly ill person. You also will read about the effects of incident stress and how to identify the signals of shock and minimize its effects. ",
                "2": "YOUR ROLE IN THE EMS SYSTEM You play a major role in making the EMS system work effectively. The EMS system is a network of community resources, including police, \ufb01 re and medical personnel\u2014and you. The system begins when someone like you recognizes that an emergency exists and decides to take action, such as calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help. The EMS dispatcher or call taker answers the call and uses the information that you give to determine what help is needed (Fig. 1-1). Emergency personnel are dispatched to the scene based on the information given. These personnel then give care at the scene and transport the injured or ill person to the hospital where emergency department staff and other professionals take over. Early arrival of emergency personnel increases a person\u2019s chance of surviving a life-threatening emergency. Calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number is the most important action that you can take. Your role in the EMS system includes four basic steps: Step 1: Recognize that an emergency exists. Step 2: Decide to act. Step 3: Activate the EMS system. Step 4: Give care until help takes over. Step 1: Recognize that an Emergency Exists Emergencies can happen to anyone, anywhere. Before you can give help, however, you must be able to recognize an emergency. You may realize that an emergency has occurred only if you become aware of unusual noises, sights, odors and appearances or behaviors. Examples include the following: Unusual noises \u25a0 Screaming, moaning, yelling or calls for help \u0002 Breaking glass, crashing metal or screeching \u0002 tires A change in the sound made by machinery \u0002 or equipment Sudden, loud noises, such as the sound of \u0002 collapsing buildings or falling ladders Unusual silence \u0002 Unusual sights \u25a0 A stopped vehicle on the roadside or a car that has \u0002 run off of the road Downed electrical wires \u0002 A person lying motionless \u0002 Spilled medication or empty container \u0002 An overturned pot in the kitchen \u0002 Sparks, smoke or \ufb01 re (Fig. 1-2, A) \u0002 Unusual odors \u25a0 Odors that are stronger than usual \u0002 Unrecognizable odors \u0002 Inappropriate odors \u0002 Unusual appearances or behaviors \u25a0 Unconsciousness (Fig. 1-2, B) \u0002 Confusion, drowsiness or unusual  behavior \u0002 (Fig. 1-2, C) Trouble breathing \u0002 Sudden collapse, slip or fall \u0002 FIGURE 1-1 EMS call taker or dispatcher FIGURE 1-2, A\u2013C Unusual sights or behavior may indicate an emergency.

                "3": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 3 Clutching the chest or throat \u0002 A person doubled over in pain \u0002 Slurred, confused or hesitant speech \u0002 Sweating for no apparent reason \u0002 Uncharacteristic skin color \u0002 Inability to move a body part \u0002 Step 2: Decide to Act Once you recognize that an emergency has occurred, you must decide how to help and what to do. There are many ways you can help in an emergency, but in order to help, you must act. Overcoming Barriers to Act Being faced with an emergency may bring out mixed feelings. While wanting to help, you also may feel hesitant or may want to back away from the situation. These feelings are personal and real. Sometimes, even though people recognize that an emergency has occurred, they fail to act. The most common factors that keep people from responding are: Panic or fear of doing something wrong \u25a0 Being unsure of the person\u2019s condition and what to do \u25a0 Assuming someone else will take action \u25a0 Type of injury or illness \u25a0 Fear of catching a disease (see the Disease \u25a0 Transmission and Prevention section in this chapter) Fear of being sued (see discussion of Good Samaritan \u25a0 laws in this chapter) Being unsure of when to call 9-1-1 or the local \u25a0 emergency number Panic or Fear of Doing Something Wrong People react differently in emergencies. Some people are afraid of doing the wrong thing and making matters worse. Sometimes people simply panic. Knowing what to do in an emergency can instill con\ufb01 dence that can help you to avoid panic and be able to provide the right care. If you are not sure what to do, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and follow the instructions of the EMS dispatcher or call taker. The worst thing to do is nothing. Being Unsure of the Person\u2019s Condition and What to Do Because most emergencies happen in or near the home, you are more likely to \ufb01 nd yourself giving care to a family member or a friend than to someone you do not know. However, you may be faced with an emergency situation involving a stranger, and you might feel uneasy about helping someone whom you do not know. For example, the person may be much older or much younger than you, be of a different gender or race, have a disabling condition, be of a different status at work or be the victim of a crime. Sometimes, people who have been injured or become suddenly ill may act strangely or be uncooperative. The injury or illness; stress; or other factors, such as the effects of drugs, alcohol or medications, may make people unpleasant or angry. Do not take this behavior personally. If you feel at all threatened by the person\u2019s behavior, leave the immediate area and call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help. Assuming Someone Else Will Take Action If several people are standing around, it might not be easy to tell if anyone is giving care. Always ask if you can help. Just because there is a crowd does not mean someone is caring for the injured or ill person. In fact, you may be the only one on the scene who knows \ufb01 rst aid. Although you may feel embarrassed about coming forward in front of other people, this should not stop you from offering help. Someone has to take action in an emergency, and it may have to be you. If others already are giving care, ask if you can help. If bystanders do not appear to be helping, tell them how to help. You can ask them to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, meet the ambulance and direct it to your location, keep the area free of onlookers and traf\ufb01 c, send them for blankets or other supplies such as a \ufb01 rst aid kit or an automated external de\ufb01 brillator (AED), or help to give care. The Type of Injury or Illness An injury or illness sometimes may be very unpleasant. Blood, vomit, bad odors, deformed body parts, or torn or burned skin can be very upsetting. You may have to turn away for a moment and take a few deep breaths to get control of your feelings before you can give care. If you still are unable to give care, you can help in other ways, such as volunteering to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. Fear of Catching a Disease Many people worry about the possibility of being infected with a disease while giving care. Although it is possible for diseases to be transmitted in a \ufb01 rst aid situation, it is extremely unlikely that you will catch a disease this way. (For more information on disease transmission, see the Disease Transmission section in this chapter.) ",
                "4": "Fear of Being Sued Sometimes people worry that they might be sued for giving care. In fact, lawsuits against people who give emergency care at a scene of an accident are highly unusual and rarely successful. Good Samaritan Laws The vast majority of states and the District of Columbia have Good Samaritan laws that protect people against claims of negligence when they give emergency care in good faith without accepting anything in return. Good Samaritan laws usually protect citizens who act the same way that a \u201creasonable and prudent person\u201d would if that person were in the same situation. For example, a reasonable and prudent person would: Move a person only if the person\u2019s life were in danger. \u25a0 Ask a conscious person for permission, also called \u25a0 consent, before giving care. Check the person for life-threatening conditions \u25a0 before giving further care. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. \u25a0 Continue to give care until more highly trained \u25a0 personnel take over. Good Samaritan laws were developed to encourage people to help others in emergency situations. They require the \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d to use common sense and a reasonable level of skill and to give only the type of emergency care for which he or she is trained. They assume each person would do his or her best to save a life or prevent further injury. Non-professionals who respond to emergencies, also called \u201clay responders,\u201d rarely are sued for helping in an emergency. Good Samaritan laws protect the responder from \ufb01 nancial responsibility. In cases in which a lay responder\u2019s actions were deliberately negligent or reckless or when the responder abandoned the person after starting care, the courts have ruled Good Samaritan laws do not protect the responder. For more information about your state\u2019s Good Samaritan laws, contact a legal professional or check with your local library. Being Unsure When to Call 9-1-1 People sometimes are afraid to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number because they are not sure that the situation is a real emergency and do not want to waste the time of the EMS personnel. Your decision to act in an emergency should be guided by your own values and by your knowledge of the risks that may be present. However, even if you decide not to give care, you should at least call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number to get emergency medical help to the scene. Step 3: Activate the EMS System Activating the EMS system by calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number is the most important step you can take in an emergency. Remember, some facilities, such as hotels, of\ufb01 ce and university buildings, and some stores, require you to dial a 9 or some other number to get an outside line before you dial 9-1-1. Also, a few areas still are without access to a 9-1-1 system and use a local emergency number instead. Becoming familiar with your local system is important because the rapid arrival of emergency medical help greatly increases a person\u2019s chance of surviving a life-threatening emergency. When your call is answered, an emergency call taker (or dispatcher) will ask for your phone number, address, location of the emergency and questions to determine whether you need police, \ufb01 re or medical assistance. You should not hang up before the call taker does so. Once EMS personnel are on the way, the call taker may stay on the line and continue to talk with you. Many call takers also are trained to give \ufb01 rst aid instructions so they can assist you with life-saving techniques until EMS personnel take over. Step 4: Give Care Until Help Takes Over This manual and the American Red Cross First Aid/ CPR/AED courses provide you with the con\ufb01 dence, knowledge and skills you need to give care to a person in an emergency medical situation. In general, you should give the appropriate care to an ill or injured person until: You see an obvious sign of life, such as breathing. \u25a0 Another trained responder or EMS personnel \u25a0 take over. You are too exhausted to continue. \u25a0 The scene becomes unsafe. \u25a0 If you are prepared for unforeseen emergencies, you can help to ensure that care begins as soon as possible for yourself, your family and your fellow citizens. If you are trained in \ufb01 rst aid, you can give help that can save a life in the \ufb01 rst few minutes of an emergency. First aid can be the difference between life and death. Often, it makes the difference between complete recovery and permanent disability. By knowing what to do and acting on that knowledge, you can make a difference. ",
                "5": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 5 Getting Permission to Give Care People have a basic right to decide what can and cannot be done to their bodies. They have the legal right to accept or refuse emergency care. Therefore, before giving care to an injured or ill person, you must obtain the person\u2019s permission. To get permission from a conscious person, you must \ufb01 rst tell the person who you are, how much training you have (such as training in \ufb01 rst aid, CPR and/or AED), what you think is wrong and what you plan to do. You also must ask if you may give care. When a conscious person who understands your questions and what you plan to do gives you permission to give care, this is called expressed consent . Do not touch or give care to a conscious person who refuses it. If the person refuses care or withdraws consent at any time, step back and call for more advanced medical personnel. Sometimes, adults may not be able to give expressed consent. This includes people who are unconscious or unable to respond, confused, mentally impaired, seriously injured or seriously ill. In these cases, the law assumes that if the person could respond, he or she would agree to care. This is called implied consent. If the conscious person is a child or an infant, permission to give care must be obtained from a parent or guardian when one is available. If the condition is life threatening, permission\u2014or consent\u2014is implied if a parent or guardian is not present. If the parent or guardian is present but does not give consent, do not give care. Instead, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND PREVENTION Infectious diseases\u2014those that can spread from one person to another\u2014develop when germs invade the body and cause illness. How Disease Spreads The most common germs are bacteria and viruses. Bacteria can live outside of the body and do not depend on other organisms for life. The number of ba cteria that infect humans is small, but some cause serious infections. These can be treated with medications called antibiotics. Viruses depend on other organisms to live. Once in the body, it is hard to stop their progression. Few medications can \ufb01 ght viruses. The body\u2019s immune system is its number one protection against infection. Bacteria and viruses spread from one person to another through direct or indirect contact. Direct contact occurs when germs from the person\u2019s blood or other body \ufb02 uids pass directly into your body through breaks or cuts in your skin or through the lining of your mouth, nose or eyes. Some diseases, such as the common cold, are transmitted by droplets in the air we breathe. They can be passed on through indirect contact with shared objects like spoons, doorknobs and pencils that have been exposed to the droplets. Fortunately, exposure to these germs usually is not adequate for diseases to be transmitted. Animals, including humans and insects, also can spread some diseases through bites. Contracting a disease from a bite is rare in any situation and uncommon when giving \ufb01 rst aid care. Some diseases are spread more easily than others. Some of these, like the \ufb02 u, can create discomfort but often are temporary and usually not serious for healthy adults. Other germs can be more serious, such as the Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Human Immunode\ufb01 ciency Virus (HIV), which causes Acquired Immune De\ufb01 ciency Syndrome (AIDS) (see HIV and AIDS box in this chapter). Although serious, they are not easily transmitted and are not spread by casual contact, such as shaking hands. The primary way to transmit HBV, HCV or HIV during \ufb01 rst aid care is through blood-to-blood contact. Preventing Disease Transmission By following some basic guidelines, you can greatly decrease your risk of getting or transmitting an infectious disease while giving care or cleaning up a blood spill. While Giving Care To prevent disease transmission when giving care, follow what are known as standard precautions: Avoid contact with blood and other body \ufb02 uids \u25a0 or objects that may be soiled with blood and other body \ufb02 uids. Use protective CPR breathing barriers. \u25a0 Use barriers, such as disposable gloves, between the \u25a0 person\u2019s blood or body \ufb02 uids and yourself. Before putting on personal protective equipment \u25a0 (PPE), such as disposable gloves, cover any of your own cuts, scrapes or sores with a bandage. Do not eat, drink or touch your mouth, nose or eyes \u25a0 when giving care or before you wash your hands after care has been given. ",
                "6": "FOCUS ON PREPAREDNESS Important Information Keep medical information about you and \u25a0 your family in a handy place, such as on the refrigerator door or in your car\u2019s glove compartment. Keep medical and insurance records up to date. Wear a medical ID tag, bracelet or necklace \u25a0 if you have a potentially serious medical condition, such as epilepsy, diabetes, heart disease or allergies. Make sure your house or apartment number is \u25a0 easy to read. Numerals are easier to read than spelled-out numbers. Emergency Telephone Numbers Keep all emergency telephone numbers in a \u25a0 handy place, such as by the telephone or in the \ufb01 rst aid kit. Include home and work numbers of family members and friends. Be sure to keep both lists current. If your wireless phone came pre-programmed \u25a0 with the auto-dial 9-1-1 feature turned on, turn off the feature. Do not program your phone to automatically \u25a0 dial 9-1-1 when one button, such as the \u201c9\u201d key is pressed. Unintentional 9-1-1 calls, which often occur with auto-dial keys, cause problems for emergency call centers. Lock your keypad when you\u2019re not using your \u25a0 wireless phone. This action prevents automatic calls to 9-1-1. Most communities are served by an emergency \u25a0 9-1-1 telephone number. If your community does not operate on a 9-1-1 system, look up the numbers for the police, \ufb01 re department and EMS personnel. Emergency numbers usually are listed in the front of the telephone book. Know the number for the National Poison Control Center Hotline, 1-800-222-1222, and post it on or near your telephones. Teach everyone in your home how and when to use these numbers. Many 9-1-1 calls in the United States are not \u25a0 emergencies. For this reason, some cities have started using 3-1-1 (or similar) as a number for people to call for non-emergency situations. Find out if your area uses this number. Remember, your local emergency number is for just that\u2014 emergencies! So, please use good judgment. First Aid Kit Keep a \ufb01 rst aid kit in your home, car, workplace \u25a0 and recreation area. A well-stocked \ufb01 rst aid kit is a handy thing to have. Carry a \ufb01 rst aid kit with you or know where you can \ufb01 nd one. Find out the location of \ufb01 rst aid kits where you work or for any place where you spend a lot of time. First aid kits come in many shapes and sizes. You can purchase one from redcross.org or the local American Red Cross chapter. Your local drug store may sell them. You also may make your own. Some kits are designed for speci\ufb01 c activities, such as hiking, camping or boating. Whether you buy a \ufb01 rst aid kit or put one together, make sure it has all of the items you may need. Include any personal items such as medications and emergency phone numbers or other items suggested by your health care provider. Check the kit regularly. Make sure that \ufb02 ashlight batteries work. Check expiration dates and replace any used or out-of-date contents. The Red Cross recommends that all \ufb01 rst aid \u25a0 kits for a family of four include the following: 2 absorbent compress dressings \u0002 (5 x 9 inches) 25 adhesive bandages (assorted sizes) \u0002 BE PREPARED FOR AN INJURY OR ILLNESS!

Do not touch objects that may be soiled with blood or \u25a0 other body \ufb02 uids. Be prepared by having a \ufb01 rst aid kit handy and \u25a0 stocked with PPE, such as disposable gloves, CPR breathing barriers, eye protection and other supplies. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm \u25a0 running water when you have \ufb01 nished giving care, even if you wore disposable gloves. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers allow you to clean your hands when soap and water are not readily available and your hands are not visibly soiled. (Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of reach of children.) Tell EMS personnel at the scene or your health care \u25a0 provider if you have come into contact with an injured or ill person\u2019s body \ufb02 uids. If an exposure occurs in a workplace setting, \u25a0 follow your company\u2019s exposure control plan for reporting incidents and follow-up (post-exposure) evaluation. While Cleaning Up Blood Spills To prevent disease transmission while cleaning up a blood spill: Clean up the spill immediately or as soon as possible \u25a0 after the spill occurs (Fig. 1-3). Use disposable gloves and other PPE when \u25a0 cleaning spills. Wipe up the spill with paper towels or other \u25a0 absorbent material. If the spill is mixed with sharp objects, such \u0002 as broken glass or needles, do not pick these up with your hands. Use tongs, a broom and dustpan or two pieces of cardboard to scoop up the sharp objects.

For more information on preventing disease transmission, visit the federal Occupational Safety and Health administration: http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/bloodbornepathogens/ index.html. TAKING ACTION: EMERGENCY ACTION STEPS In any emergency situation, follow the emergency action steps: 1. CHECK the scene and the person. 2. CALL 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. 3. CARE for the person. CHECK Before you can help an injured or ill person, make sure that the scene is safe for you and any bystanders (Fig. 1-4). Look the scene over and try to answer these questions: FOCUS ON PREVENTION AIDS is a condition caused by HIV. When HIV infects the body, it damages the body\u2019s immune system and impairs its ability to \ufb01 ght other infections. The virus can grow quietly for months or even years. People infected with HIV might not feel or look sick. Eventually, the weakened immune system allows certain types of infections to develop. This condition is known as AIDS. People with AIDS eventually develop life-threatening infections, which can cause them to die. Because currently there is no vaccine against HIV, prevention still is the best tool. The two most likely ways for HIV to be transmitted during care would be through: Unprotected direct contact with infected \u25a0 blood. This type of transmission could happen if infected blood or body \ufb02 uids from one person enter another person\u2019s body at a correct entry site. For example, a responder could contract HIV if the infected person\u2019s blood splashes in the responder\u2019s eye or if the responder directly touches the infected person\u2019s body \ufb02 uids. Unprotected indirect contact with infected \u25a0 blood. This type of transmission could happen if a person touches an object that contains the blood or other body \ufb02 uids of an infected person, and that infected blood or other body \ufb02 uid enters the body through a correct entry site. For example, HIV could be transmitted if a responder picks up a blood-soaked bandage with a bare hand and the infected blood enters the responder\u2019s hand through a cut in the skin. The virus cannot enter through the skin unless there is a cut or break in the skin. Even then, the possibility of infection is very low unless there is direct contact for a lengthy period of time. Saliva is not known to transmit HIV. The likelihood of HIV transmission during a \ufb01 rst aid situation is very low. Always give care in ways that protect you and the person from disease transmission. For more information on preventing HIV transmission, see the Preventing Disease Transmission section in this chapter. If you think you have put yourself at risk for an infectious disease, get tested. Tests are readily available and will tell whether your body is producing antibodies in response to the virus. If you are not sure whether you should be tested, call your health care provider, the public health department, an AIDS service organization or the AIDS hotline listed in the next paragraph. If you have any questions about AIDS, call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 24 hours a day, for information in English and Spanish at 1-800-232-4636.

                "9": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 9 Is it safe? \u25a0 Is immediate danger involved? \u25a0 What happened? \u25a0 How many people are involved? \u25a0 Is anyone else available to help? \u25a0 What is wrong? \u25a0 Is It Safe? Check for anything unsafe, such as spilled chemicals, traf\ufb01 c, \ufb01 re, escaping steam, downed electrical lines, smoke or extreme weather. Avoid going into con\ufb01 ned areas with no ventilation or fresh air, places where there might be poisonous gas, collapsed structures, or places where natural gas, propane or other substances could explode. Such areas should be entered by responders who have special training and equipment, such as respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus. If these or other dangers threaten, stay at a safe distance and call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. If the scene still is unsafe after you call, do not enter. Dead or injured heroes are no help to anyone! Leave dangerous situations to professionals like \ufb01 re\ufb01 ghters and police. Once they make the scene safe, you can offer to help. Is Immediate Danger Involved? Do not move a seriously injured person unless there is an immediate danger, such as \ufb01 re, \ufb02 ood or poisonous gas; you have to reach another person who may have a more serious injury or illness; or you need to move the injured person to give proper care and you are able to do so without putting yourself in danger from the \ufb01 re, \ufb02 ood or poisonous gas. If you must move the person, do it as quickly and carefully as possible. If there is no danger, tell the person not to move. Tell any bystanders not to move the person. What Happened? Look for clues to what caused the emergency and how the person might be injured. Nearby objects, such as a fallen ladder, broken glass or a spilled bottle of medicine, may give you information. Your check of the scene may be the only way to tell what happened. If the injured or ill person is a child, keep in mind that he or she may have been moved by well-meaning adults. Be sure to ask about this when you are checking out what happened. If you \ufb01 nd that a child has been moved, ask the adult where the child was and how he or she was found. How Many People Are Involved? Look carefully for more than one person. You might not spot everyone at \ufb01 rst. If one person is bleeding or screaming, you might not notice an unconscious person. It also is easy to overlook a small child or an infant. In an emergency with more than one injured or ill person, you may need to prioritize care (in other words, decide who needs help \ufb01 rst). Is Anyone Else Available to Help? You already have learned that the presence of bystanders does not mean that a person is receiving help. You may have to ask them to help. Bystanders may be able to tell you what happened or make the call for help while you provide care. If a family member, friend or co-worker is present, he or she may know if the person is ill or has a medical condition. The injured or ill person may be too upset to answer your questions. Anyone who awakens after having been FIGURE 1-4 Check the scene for anything that may threaten the safety of you, the injured persons and bystanders. ",
                "10": "unconscious also may be frightened. Bystanders can help to comfort the person and others at the scene. A child may be especially frightened. Parents or guardians who are present may be able to calm a frightened child. They also can tell you if a child has a medical condition. What Is Wrong? When you reach the person, try to \ufb01 nd out what is wrong. Look for signals that may indicate a life-threatening emergency. First, check to see if the injured or ill person is conscious (Fig. 1-5). Sometimes this is obvious. The person may be able to speak to you. He or she may be moaning, crying, making some other noise or moving around. If the person is conscious, reassure him or her and try to \ufb01 nd out what happened. If the person is lying on the ground, silent and not moving, he or she may be unconscious. If you are not sure whether someone is unconscious, tap him or her on the shoulder and ask if he or she is OK. Use the person\u2019s name if you know it. Speak loudly. If you are not sure whether an infant is unconscious, check by tapping the infant\u2019s shoulders and shouting or \ufb02 icking the bottom of the infant\u2019s foot to see if the infant responds. Unconsciousness is a life-threatening emergency. If the person does not respond to you in any way, assume that he or she is unconscious. Make sure that someone calls 9-1-1 or the local emergency number right away. For purposes of \ufb01 rst aid, an adult is de\ufb01 ned as someone about age 12 (adolescent) or older; someone between the ages of 1 and 12 is considered to be a child; and an infant is someone younger than 1 year. When using an AED, a child is considered to be someone between the ages of 1 and 8 years or weighing less than 55 pounds. Look for other signals of life-threatening injuries including trouble breathing, the absence of breathing or breathing that is not normal, and/or severe bleeding. While you are checking the person, use your senses of sight, smell and hearing. They will help you to notice anything abnormal. For example, you may notice an unusual smell that could be caused by a poison. You may see a bruise or a twisted arm or leg. You may hear the person say something that explains how he or she was injured. Checking Children and the Elderly Keep in mind that it is often helpful to take a slightly different approach when you check and care for children, infants and elderly people in an emergency situation. For more information on checking and caring for children, infants, the elderly and others with special needs, see Chapter 9. Identifying Life-Threatening Conditions At times you may be unsure if advanced medical personnel are needed. Your \ufb01 rst aid training will help you to make this decision. The most important step you can take when giving care to a person who is unconscious or has some other life-threatening condition is to call for emergency medical help. With a life-threatening condition, the survival of a person often depends on both emergency medical help and the care you can give. You will have to use your best judgment\u2014 based on the situation, your assessment of the injured or ill person, information gained from this course and other training you may have received\u2014to make the decision to call. When in doubt, and you think a life-threatening condition is present, make the call. CALL Calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help often is the most important action you can take to help an injured or ill person (Fig. 1-6). It will send emergency medical help on its way as fast as possible. Make the call quickly and return to the person. If possible, ask someone else to make the call. As a general rule, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the person has any of the following conditions: Unconsciousness or an altered level of consciousness \u25a0 (LOC), such as drowsiness or confusion Breathing problems (trouble breathing or no breathing) \u25a0 Chest pain, discomfort or pressure lasting more than \u25a0 a few minutes that goes away and comes back or that radiates to the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, stomach or back Persistent abdominal pain or pressure \u25a0 Severe external bleeding (bleeding that spurts \u25a0 or gushes steadily from a wound) Vomiting blood or passing blood \u25a0 Severe (critical) burns \u25a0 Suspected poisoning \u25a0 FIGURE 1-5 When you reach the person, \ufb01 rst check to see if he or she is conscious.

                "11": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 11 CARE Once you have checked the scene and the person and have made a decision about calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, you may need to give care until EMS personnel take over. After making the 9-1-1 call, immediately go back to the injured or ill person. Check the person for life-threatening conditions and give the necessary care (see Checking a Conscious and Unconscious Person section in this chapter). To do so, follow these general guidelines: Do no further harm. \u25a0 Monitor the person\u2019s breathing and consciousness. \u25a0 Help the person rest in the most comfortable position. \u25a0 Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. \u25a0 Reassure the person. \u25a0 Give any speci\ufb01 c care as needed. \u25a0 Transporting the Person Yourself In some cases, you may decide to take the injured or ill person to a medical facility yourself instead of waiting for EMS personnel. NEVER transport a person: When the trip may aggravate the injury or illness or \u25a0 cause additional injury. When the person has or may develop a life- \u25a0 threatening condition. If you are unsure of the nature of the injury or illness. \u25a0 If you decide it is safe to transport the person, ask someone to come with you to keep the person comfortable. Also, be sure you know the quickest route to the nearest medical facility capable of handling emergency care. Pay close attention to the injured or ill person and watch for any changes in his or her condition. Discourage an injured or ill person from driving him- or herself to the hospital. An injury may restrict movement, or the person may become groggy or faint. A sudden onset of pain may be distracting. Any of these conditions can make driving dangerous for the person, passengers, other drivers and pedestrians. Moving an Injured or Ill Person One of the most dangerous threats to a seriously injured or ill person is unnecessary movement. Moving an injured person can cause additional injury and pain and may complicate his or her recovery. Generally, you should not move an injured or ill person while giving care. However, it would be appropriate in the following three situations: 1. When you are faced with immediate danger, such as \ufb01 re, lack of oxygen, risk of explosion or a collapsing structure. 2. When you have to get to another person who may have a more serious problem. In this case, you may have to move a person with minor injuries to reach someone needing immediate care. Seizures \u25a0 Stroke (sudden weakness on one side of the face/ \u25a0 facial droop, sudden weakness on one side of the body, sudden slurred speech or trouble getting words out or a sudden, severe headache) Suspected or obvious injuries to the head, neck or spine \u25a0 Painful, swollen, deformed areas (suspected broken \u25a0 bone) or an open fracture Also call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately for any of these situations: Fire or explosion \u25a0 Downed electrical wires \u25a0 Swiftly moving or rapidly rising water \u25a0 Presence of poisonous gas \u25a0 Serious motor-vehicle collisions \u25a0 Injured or ill persons who cannot be moved easily \u25a0 Deciding to Call First or Care First If you are ALONE: Call First \u25a0 (call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number before giving care) for: Any adult or child about 12 years of age or older \u0002 who is unconscious. A child or an infant who you witnessed \u0002 suddenly collapse. An unconscious child or infant known to have \u0002 heart problems. Care First \u25a0 (give 2 minutes of care, then call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number) for: An unconscious child (younger than about \u0002 12 years of age) who you did not see collapse. Any drowning victim. \u0002 Call First situations are likely to be cardiac emergencies, where time is a critical factor. In Care First situations, the conditions often are related to breathing emergencies.

For example, if someone needed CPR, he or she might have to be moved from a bed because CPR needs to be performed on a \ufb01 rm, \ufb02 at surface. If the surface or space is not adequate to give care, the person should be moved. Techniques for Moving an Injured or Ill Person Once you decide to move an injured or ill person, you must quickly decide how to do so. Carefully consider your safety and the safety of the person. Move an injured or ill person only when it is safe for you to do so and there is an immediate life threat. Base your decision on the dangers you are facing, the size and condition of the person, your abilities and physical condition, and whether you have any help. To improve your chances of successfully moving an injured or ill person without injuring yourself or the person: Use your legs, not your back, when you bend. \u25a0 Bend at the knees and hips and avoid twisting \u25a0 your body. Walk forward when possible, taking small steps and \u25a0 looking where you are going. Avoid twisting or bending anyone with a possible \u25a0 head, neck or spinal injury. Do not move a person who is too large to \u25a0 move comfortably. You can move a person to safety in many different ways, but no single way is best for every situation. The objective is to move the person without injuring yourself or causing further injury to the person. The following common types of emergency moves can all be done by one or two people and with minimal to no equipment. Types of Non-Emergency Moves Walking Assist The most basic emergency move is the walking assist. Either one or two responders can use this method with a conscious person. To perform a walking assist, place the injured or ill person\u2019s arm across your shoulders and hold it in place with one hand. Support the person with your other hand around the person\u2019s waist (Fig. 1-7, A). In this way, your body acts as a crutch, supporting the person\u2019s weight while you both walk. A second responder, if present, can support the person in the same way on the other side (Fig. 1-7, B). Do not use this assist if you suspect that the person has a head, neck or spinal injury. Two-Person Seat Carry The two-person seat carry requires a second responder. This carry can be used for any person who is conscious and not seriously injured. Put one arm behind the person\u2019s thighs and the other across the person\u2019s back. Interlock your arms with those of a second responder behind the person\u2019s legs and across his or her back. Lift the person in the \u201cseat\u201d formed by the responders\u2019 arms (Fig. 1-8). Responders should coordinate their movement so they walk together. Do not use this assist if you suspect that the person has a head, neck or spinal injury. Types of Emergency Moves Pack-Strap Carry The pack-strap carry can be used with conscious and unconscious persons. Using it with an unconscious person requires a second responder to help position the injured or ill person on your back. To perform the FIGURE 1-7, A\u2013B A, In a walking assist, your body acts as a crutch, supporting the person\u2019s weight while you both walk.

Position yourself with your back to the person, back straight, knees bent, so that your shoulders \ufb01 t into the person\u2019s armpits. Cross the person\u2019s arms in front of you and grasp the person\u2019s wrists. Lean forward slightly and pull the person up and onto your back. Stand up and walk to safety (Fig. 1-9). Depending on the size of the person, you may be able to hold both of his or her wrists with one hand, leaving your other hand free to help maintain balance, open doors and remove obstructions. Do not use this assist if you suspect that the person has a head, neck or spinal injury. Clothes Drag The clothes drag can be used to move a conscious or unconscious person with a suspected head, neck or spinal injury. This move helps keep the person\u2019s head, neck and back stabilized. Grasp the person\u2019s clothing behind the neck, gathering enough to secure a \ufb01 rm grip. Using the clothing, pull the person (head\ufb01 rst) to safety (Fig. 1-10). During this move, the person\u2019s head is cradled by clothing and the responder\u2019s arms. Be aware that this move is exhausting and may cause back strain for the responder, even when done properly. Blanket Drag The blanket drag can be used to move a person in an emergency situation when equipment is limited. Keep the person between you and the blanket. Gather half of the blanket and place it against the person\u2019s side. Roll the person as a unit toward you. Reach over and place the blanket so that it is positioned under the person, then roll the person onto the blanket. Gather the blanket at the head and move the person (Fig. 1-11). Ankle Drag Use the ankle drag (also known as the foot drag) to move a person who is too large to carry or move in any other way. Firmly grasp the person\u2019s ankles and move backward. The person\u2019s arms should be crossed on his FIGURE 1-10 The clothes drag FIGURE 1-11 The blanket drag FIGURE 1-8 The two-person seat carry FIGURE 1-9 The pack-strap carry ",

Reaching a Person in the Water Do not enter the water unless you are speci\ufb01 cally trained to perform in-water rescues. Get help from a trained responder, such as a lifeguard, to get the person out of the water as quickly and safely as possible. You can help a person in trouble in the water from a safe position by using reaching assists , throwing assists or wading assists . When possible, start by talking to the person. Let the person know that help is coming. If noise is a problem or if the person is too far away to hear you, use nonverbal communication. Direct the person what to do, such as grasping a line, ring buoy or other object that \ufb02 oats. Ask the person to move toward you, which may be done by using the back \ufb02 oat with slight leg movements or small strokes. Some people can reach safety by themselves with the calm and encouraging assistance of someone calling to them. Reaching Assists. \u25a0 Firmly brace yourself on a pool deck, pier or shoreline and reach out to the person with any object that will extend your reach, such as a pole, oar or paddle, tree branch, shirt, belt or towel. If no equipment is available, you can still perform a reaching assist by lying down and extending your arm or leg for the person to grab. Throwing Assists. \u25a0 An effective way to rescue someone beyond your reach is to throw a \ufb02 oating object out to the person with a line attached. Once the person grasps the object, pull the individual to safety. Throwing equipment includes heaving lines, ring buoys, throw bags or any \ufb02 oating object available, such as a picnic jug, small cooler, buoyant cushion, kickboard or extra life jacket. Wading Assists. \u25a0 If the water is safe and shallow enough (not over your chest), you can wade in to reach the person. If there is a current or the bottom is soft or unknown, making it dangerous to wade, do not go in the water. If possible, wear a life jacket and take something with you to extend your reach, such as a ring buoy, buoyant cushion, kickboard, life jacket, tree branch, pole, air mattress, plastic cooler, picnic jug, paddle or water exercise belt. CHECKING A CONSCIOUS PERSON If you determine that an injured or ill person is conscious and has no immediate life-threatening conditions, you can begin to check for other conditions that may need care. Checking a conscious person with no immediate life-threatening conditions involves two basic steps: Interview the person and bystanders. \u25a0 Check the person from head to toe. \u25a0 Conducting Interviews Ask the person and bystanders simple questions to learn more about what happened. Keep these interviews brief (Fig. 1-13). Remember to \ufb01 rst identify yourself and to get the person\u2019s consent to give care. Begin by asking the person\u2019s name. This will make him or her feel more comfortable. Gather additional information by asking the person the following questions: What happened? \u25a0 Do you feel pain or discomfort anywhere? \u25a0 Do you have any allergies? \u25a0 Do you have any medical conditions or are you taking \u25a0 any medication? FIGURE 1-12 The ankle drag FIGURE 1-13 Ask simple questions and keep interviews brief. ",
                "15": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 15 If the person feels pain, ask him or her to describe it and to tell you where it is located. Descriptions often include terms such as burning, crushing, throbbing, aching or sharp pain. Ask when the pain started and what the person was doing when it began. Ask the person to rate his or her pain on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being mild and 10 being severe). Sometimes an injured or ill person will not be able to give you the information that you need. The person may not speak your language. In some cases, the person may not be able to speak because of a medical condition. Known as a laryngectomee , a person whose larynx (voice box) was surgically removed breathes through a permanent opening, or stoma, in the neck and may not be able to speak. Remember to question family members, friends or bystanders as well. They may be able to give you helpful information or help you to communicate with the person. You will learn more about communicating with people with special needs in Chapter 9. Children or infants may be frightened. They may be fully aware of you but still unable to answer your questions. In some cases, they may be crying too hard and be unable to stop. Approach slowly and gently, and give the child or infant some time to get used to you. Use the child\u2019s name, if you know it. Get down to or below the child\u2019s eye level. Write down the information you learn during the interviews or, preferably, have someone else write it down for you. Be sure to give the information to EMS personnel when they arrive. It may help them to determine the type of medical care that the person should receive. Checking from Head to Toe Next you will need to thoroughly check the injured or ill person so that you do not overlook any problems. Visually check from head to toe. When checking a conscious person: Do not move any areas where there is pain or \u25a0 discomfort, or if you suspect a head, neck or spinal injury. Check the person\u2019s head by examining the scalp, face, \u25a0 ears, mouth and nose. Look for cuts, bruises, bumps or depressions. Think \u25a0 of how the body usually looks. If you are unsure if a body part or limb looks injured, check it against the opposite limb or the other side of the body. Watch for changes in consciousness. Notice if the \u25a0 person is drowsy, confused or is not alert. Look for changes in the person\u2019s breathing. A healthy \u25a0 person breathes easily, quietly, regularly and without discomfort or pain. Young children and infants generally breathe faster than adults. Breathing that is not normal includes noisy breathing, such as gasping for air; rasping, gurgling or whistling sounds; breathing that is unusually fast or slow; and breathing that is painful. Notice how the skin looks and feels. Skin can provide \u25a0 clues that a person is injured or ill. Feel the person\u2019s forehead with the back of your hand to determine if the skin feels unusually damp, dry, cool or hot (Fig. 1-14). Note if it is red, pale or ashen. Look over the body. Ask again about any areas that \u25a0 hurt. Ask the person to move each part of the body that does not hurt. Ask the person to gently move his or her head from side to side. Check the shoulders by asking the person to shrug them. Check the chest and abdomen by asking the person to take a deep breath. Ask the person to move his or her \ufb01 ngers, hands and arms; and then the toes, legs and hips in the same way. Watch the person\u2019s face and listen for signals of discomfort or pain as you check for injuries. Look for a medical identi\ufb01 cation (ID) tag, bracelet \u25a0 or necklace (Fig. 1-15) on the person\u2019s wrist, neck or ankle. A tag will provide medical information about the person, explain how to care for certain conditions FIGURE 1-14 Feel the forehead with the back of your hand to determine its temperature. FIGURE 1-15 Medical ID tags and bracelets can provide important information about an injured or ill person. Courtesy of the Canadian Red Cross. ",
                "16": "and list whom to call for help. For example, a person with diabetes may have some form of medical ID tag, bracelet or necklace identifying this condition. If a child or an infant becomes extremely upset, conduct a toe-to-head check of the child or infant. This will be less emotionally threatening. Parents or guardians who are present may be able to calm a frightened child. In fact, it often is helpful to check a young child while he or she is seated in his or her parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s lap. Parents also can tell you if a child has a medical condition. When you have \ufb01 nished checking, determine if the person can move his or her body without any pain. If the person can move without pain and there are no other signals of injury, have him or her attempt to rest in a sitting position or other comfortable position (Fig. 1-16). When the person feels ready, help him or her to stand up. Determine what additional care is needed and whether to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. SHOCK When the body is healthy, three conditions are needed to keep the right amount of blood \ufb02 owing: The heart must be working well. \u25a0 An adequate amount of oxygen-rich blood must be \u25a0 circulating in the body. The blood vessels must be intact and able to adjust \u25a0 blood \ufb02 ow. Shock is a condition in which the circulatory system fails to deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the body\u2019s tissues and vital organs. The body\u2019s organs, such as the brain, heart and lungs, do not function properly without this blood supply. This triggers a series of responses that produce speci\ufb01 c signals known as shock. These responses are the body\u2019s attempt to maintain adequate blood \ufb02 ow. When someone is injured or becomes suddenly ill, these normal body functions may be interrupted. In cases of minor injury or illness, this interruption is brief because the body is able to compensate quickly. With more severe injuries or illnesses, however, the body may be unable to adjust. When the body is unable to meet its demand for oxygen because blood fails to circulate adequately, shock occurs. What to Look For The signals that indicate a person may be going into shock include: Restlessness or irritability. \u25a0 Altered level of consciousness. \u25a0 Nausea or vomiting. \u25a0 Pale, ashen or grayish, cool, moist skin. \u25a0 Rapid breathing and pulse. \u25a0 Excessive thirst. \u25a0 Be aware that the early signals of shock may not be present in young children and infants. However, because children are smaller than adults, they have less blood volume and are more susceptible to shock. When to Call 9-1-1 In cases where the person is going into shock, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. Shock cannot be managed effectively by \ufb01 rst aid alone. A person suffering from shock requires emergency medical care as soon as possible. What to Do Until Help Arrives Caring for shock involves the following simple steps: Have the person lie down. \u25a0 This often is the most comfortable position. Helping the person rest in a more comfortable position may lessen any pain. Helping the person to rest comfortably is important because pain can intensify the body\u2019s stress and speed up the progression of shock. Control any external bleeding. \u25a0 Since you may not be sure of the person\u2019s condition, \u25a0 leave him or her lying \ufb02 at. Help the person maintain normal body temperature \u25a0 (Fig. 1-17). If the person is cool, try to cover him or her to avoid chilling. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink, even \u25a0 though he or she is likely to be thirsty. The person\u2019s condition may be severe enough to require surgery, in which case it is better if the stomach is empty. Reassure the person. \u25a0 FIGURE 1-16 If there are no signals of obvious injuries, help the person into a comfortable position. ",
                "17": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 17 Continue to monitor the person\u2019s breathing and for \u25a0 any changes in the person\u2019s condition. Do not wait for signals of shock to develop before caring for the underlying injury or illness. CHECKING AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON If you think someone is unconscious, tap him or her on the shoulder and ask if he or she is OK. Use the person\u2019s name if you know it. Speak loudly. If you are not sure whether an infant is unconscious, check by tapping the infant\u2019s shoulder and shouting or by \ufb02 icking the bottom of the infant\u2019s foot to see if the infant responds (Fig. 1-18). If the person does not respond, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and check for other life-threatening conditions. Always check to see if an unconscious person: Has an open airway and is breathing normally. \u25a0 Is bleeding severely. \u25a0 Consciousness, effective (normal) breathing and circulation and skin characteristics sometimes are referred to as signs of life. Airway Once you or someone else has called 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, check to see if the person has an open airway and is breathing. An open airway allows air to enter the lungs for the person to breathe. If the airway is blocked, the person cannot breathe. A blocked airway is a life-threatening condition. When someone is unconscious and lying on his \u25a0 or her back, the tongue may fall to the back of the throat and block the airway. To open an unconscious person\u2019s airway, push down on his or her forehead while pulling up on the bony part of the chin with two or three \ufb01 ngers of your other hand (Fig. 1-19). This procedure, known as the head-tilt/chin-lift technique , moves the tongue away from the back of the throat, allowing air to enter the lungs. For a child: Place one hand on the forehead \u0002 and tilt the head slightly past a neutral position FIGURE 1-17 Help the person going into shock to lie down and keep him or her from getting chilled or overheated. FIGURE 1-18 If you are not sure whether an infant is unconscious, check by tapping the infant\u2019s shoulder or \ufb02 icking the bottom of the infant\u2019s foot. FIGURE 1-19 Open an unconscious person\u2019s airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique. ",
                "18": "the head and chin are neither \ufb02 exed downward toward the chest nor extended backward). For an infant: Place one hand on the forehead and \u0002 tilt the head to a neutral position while pulling up on the bony part of the chin with two or three \ufb01 ngers of your other hand. If you suspect that a person has a head, neck or spinal \u25a0 injury, carefully tilt the head and lift the chin just enough to open the airway. Check the person\u2019s neck to see if he or she breathes through an opening. A person whose larynx was removed may breathe partially or entirely through a stoma instead of through the mouth (Fig. 1-20). The person may breathe partially or entirely through this opening instead of through the mouth and nose. It is important to recognize this difference in the way a person breathes. This will help you give proper care. Breathing After opening the airway, quickly check an unconscious person for breathing. Position yourself so that you can look to see if the person\u2019s chest clearly rises and falls, listen for escaping air and feel for it against the side of your face. Do this for no more than 10 seconds (Fig. 1-21). If the person needs CPR, chest compressions must not be delayed. Normal breathing is regular, quiet and effortless. A person does not appear to be working hard or struggling when breathing normally. This means that the person is not making noise when breathing, breaths are not fast (although it should be noted that normal breathing rates in children and infants are faster than normal breathing rates in adults) and breathing does not cause discomfort or pain. In an unconscious adult you may detect an irregular, gasping or shallow breath. This is known as an agonal breath . Do not confuse this with normal breathing. Care for the person as if there is no breathing at all. Agonal breaths do not occur frequently in children. If the person is breathing normally, his or her heart is beating and is circulating blood containing oxygen. In this case, maintain an open airway by using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique as you continue to look for other life-threatening conditions. If an adult is not breathing normally, this person most likely needs immediate CPR. If a child or an infant is not breathing, give 2 rescue breaths. Tilt the head back and lift chin up. Pinch the nose shut then make a complete seal over the child\u2019s mouth and blow in for about 1 second to make the chest clearly rise (Fig. 1-22, A). For an infant, seal your mouth over the infant\u2019s mouth and nose (Fig. 1-22, B). Give rescue breaths one after the other. If you witness the sudden collapse of a child, assume a cardiac emergency. Do not give 2 rescue breaths. CPR needs to be started immediately, just as with an adult. Sometimes you may need to remove food, liquid or other objects that are blocking the person\u2019s airway. This may prevent the chest from rising when you attempt rescue breaths. You will learn how to recognize an obstructed airway and give care to the person in Chapter 4. Circulation It is important to recognize breathing emergencies in children and infants and to act before the heart stops beating. Adults\u2019 hearts frequently stop beating because of disease. Children\u2019s and infants\u2019 hearts, however, are usually healthy. When a child\u2019s or an infant\u2019s heart stops, it usually is the result of a breathing emergency. FIGURE 1-20 A stoma is an opening in the neck that allows a person to breathe after certain surgeries on the airway. Courtesy of the International Association of Laryngectomees. FIGURE 1-21 Check for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. ",
                "19": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 19 If an adult is not breathing or is not breathing normally and if the emergency is not the result of non-fatal drowning or other respiratory cause such as a drug overdose, assume that the problem is a cardiac emergency. Quickly look for severe bleeding by looking over the person\u2019s body from head to toe for signals such as blood-soaked clothing or blood spurting out of a wound (Fig. 1-23). Bleeding usually looks worse than it is. A small amount of blood on a slick surface or mixed with water usually looks like a large volume of blood. It is not always easy to recognize severe bleeding. What to Do Next If an unconscious person is breathing normally, keep \u25a0 the person lying face-up and maintain an open airway with the head-tilt/chin-lift technique. If the person vomits, \ufb02 uids block the airway, or if you must leave the person to get help, place him or her into a modi\ufb01 ed high arm in endangered spine (H.A.IN.E.S.) recovery position. (Placing an Unconscious Person in a Recovery Position is discussed in this chapter.) If an unconscious adult has irregular, gasping or \u25a0 shallow breaths (agonal breathing) or is not breathing at all, begin CPR. You will learn how to perform CPR in Chapter 2. If an unconscious child or infant is not breathing, \u25a0 after giving 2 rescue breaths, perform CPR (see Chapter 2). If the person is bleeding severely, control the bleeding \u25a0 by applying direct pressure (see Chapter 7). Using CPR Breathing Barriers You might not feel comfortable with giving rescue breaths, especially to someone whom you do not know. Disease transmission is an understandable worry, even though the chance of getting a disease from giving rescue breaths is extremely small. CPR breathing barriers, such as face shields and resuscitation masks, create a barrier between your mouth and nose and those of the injured or ill person (Fig. 1-24). This barrier can help to protect you from contact with blood and other body \ufb02 uids, such as saliva, as you give rescue breaths. These devices also protect you from breathing the air that the person exhales. Some devices are small enough to \ufb01 t in your pocket or in the glove compartment of your car. You also can keep one in your \ufb01 rst aid kit. If a face shield is used, switch to a resuscitation mask, if available, or when one becomes available. However, you should not delay rescue breaths while searching FIGURE 1-22, A\u2013B A , Give a child 2 rescue breaths with each breath lasting about 1 second. B, For an infant, cover the mouth and nose. B A FIGURE 1-23 Check for severe bleeding by quickly looking over the person from head to toe.

                "20": "for a CPR breathing barrier or by trying to learn how to use one. Pediatric CPR breathing barriers are available and should be used to care for children and infants. Always use the appropriate equipment for the size of the injured or ill person. Special Situations When giving rescue breaths while performing CPR, you may encounter certain special situations. These include air in the stomach; vomiting; mouth-to-nose breathing; mouth-to-stoma breathing; persons with suspected head, neck or spinal injuries; and drowning victims. Air in the Stomach: When you are giving rescue \u25a0 breaths, be careful to avoid forcing air into the person\u2019s stomach instead of the lungs. This may happen if you breathe too long, breathe too hard or do not open the airway far enough. To avoid forcing air into the person\u2019s stomach, \u0002 keep the person\u2019s head tilted back. Take a normal breath and blow into the person\u2019s mouth, blowing just enough to make the chest clearly rise. Each rescue breath should last about 1 second for an adult, a child or an infant. Pause between breaths long enough for the air in the person to come out and for you to take another breath. Air in the stomach can make the person \u0002 vomit and cause complications. When an unconscious person vomits, the contents of the stomach can get into the lungs and block breathing. Air in the stomach also makes it harder for the diaphragm\u2014 the large muscle that controls breathing\u2014to move. This makes it harder for the lungs to \ufb01 ll with air. Vomiting. Even when you are giving rescue breaths \u25a0 properly, the person may vomit. If this happens, roll the person onto one side and \u0002 wipe the mouth clean (Fig. 1-25). If possible, use a protective barrier, such as disposable gloves, gauze or even a handkerchief when cleaning out the mouth. Then roll the person on his or her back again and \u0002 continue giving care as necessary. Mouth-to-Nose Breathing. If you are unable to make \u25a0 a tight enough seal over the person\u2019s mouth, you can blow into the nose (Fig. 1-26). With the head tilted back, close the mouth by \u0002 pushing on the chin. Seal your mouth around the person\u2019s nose and \u0002 breathe into the nose. If possible, open the person\u2019s mouth between \u0002 rescue breaths to let the air out. Mouth-to-Stoma Breathing. \u25a0 Check the person\u2019s neck to see if he or she breathes through a stoma. If you discover that the person needing rescue \u0002 breaths has a stoma, expose his or her entire neck down to the breastbone. Remove anything covering the stoma that blocks the person\u2019s airway. Also, wipe away any secretions or blockages. Keep the airway in a neutral position; do not \u0002 allow the chin or head to \ufb02 ex forward toward the chest or extend backward as you look, listen and feel for normal breathing with your ear over the stoma. To give rescue breaths, make an airtight seal with your lips around the stoma or tracheostomy tube and blow in for about 1 second to make the chest clearly rise. FIGURE 1-25 If the person vomits, roll him or her onto one side and wipe the mouth clean. FIGURE 1-26 If you are unable to make a tight enough seal over the person\u2019s mouth, you can blow into the nose. ",
                "21": "Before Giving Care and Checking an Injured or Ill Person 21 Give rescue breaths into the stoma at the same \u0002 rate you would breathe into the mouth when performing CPR. Your rescue breaths are successful if you see the chest rise and fall and you hear and feel air escape from the stoma. If the chest does not rise and fall, the person\u2019s \u0002 tracheostomy tube may be blocked. If this happens, remove the inner tube and give rescue breaths again. If you hear or feel air escaping from the person\u2019s \u0002 mouth or nose, the person is a partial neck breather. In order to give rescue breaths to a partial neck breather, the responder must seal the person\u2019s mouth and nose with either his or her hand or a tight-\ufb01 tting face mask so that air does not escape out of the mouth or nose when you give rescue breaths into the stoma or tracheostomy tube. You might feel uncomfortable with the thought \u0002 of giving mouth-to-stoma rescue breaths. An alternative method is to use a barrier device (see Using CPR Breathing Barriers section in this chapter). For a neck breather or partial neck breather, a round pediatric mask may provide a better seal around a stoma or tracheostomy tube neck plate (Fig. 1-27). Head, Neck and Spinal Injuries. Be especially careful \u25a0 with a person who may have a head, neck or spinal injury. These kinds of injuries can result from a fall from a height greater than the person\u2019s height, an automobile collision or a diving mishap. If you suspect such an injury, try not to move the person\u2019s head, neck and back. If a child is strapped into a car seat, do not remove him or her from it. To give rescue breaths to a person whom you suspect has a head, neck or spinal injury: Minimize movement of the head and neck when \u0002 opening the airway. Carefully tilt the head and lift the chin just enough \u0002 to open the airway. Drowning Victims. For an adult, give 2 rescue \u25a0 breaths as you would for a child or an infant once you determine there is no breathing. If alone, you should give 2 minutes of care before calling 9-1-1 (Care First) for an unconscious person who has been submerged. Do not enter the water unless you are speci\ufb01 cally trained to perform in-water rescues. Get help from a trained responder, such as a lifeguard, to get the person out of the water as quickly and safely as possible. If the person is not breathing, you will have to give proper care. Placing an Unconscious Person in a Recovery Position In some cases, the person may be unconscious but breathing normally. Generally, that person should not be moved from a face-up position, especially if there is a suspected spinal injury. However, there are a few situations when you should move a person into a recovery position whether or not a spinal injury is suspected. Examples include situations where you are alone and have to leave the person (e.g., to call for help), or you cannot maintain an open and clear airway because of \ufb02 uids or vomit. Fig. 1-28, A\u2013B shows how to place a person, whether or not a spinal injury is suspected, in a modi\ufb01 ed H.A.IN.E.S. recovery position. Placing a person in this position will help to keep the airway open and clear. To place an adult or a child in a modi\ufb01 ed H.A.IN.E.S. recovery position: Kneel at the person\u2019s side. \u25a0 Reach across the body and lift the arm farthest \u25a0 from you up next to the head with the person\u2019s palm facing up. Take the person\u2019s arm closest to you and place it next \u25a0 to his or her side. Grasp the leg farthest from you and bend it up. \u25a0 Using your hand that is closest to the person\u2019s \u25a0 head, cup the base of the skull in the palm of your hand and carefully slide your forearm under the person\u2019s shoulder closest to you. Do not lift or push the head or neck. Place your other hand under the arm and hip closest \u25a0 to you. Using a smooth motion, roll the person away from \u25a0 you by lifting with your hand and forearm. Make sure the person\u2019s head remains in contact with the extended arm and be sure to support the head and neck with your hand. Stop all movement when the person is on his or \u25a0 her side.

An infant can be placed in a recovery position as would be done for an older child. You can also hold an infant in a recovery position (Fig. 1-29) by: Carefully positioning the infant face-down along your \u25a0 forearm.

INCIDENT STRESS After responding to an emergency involving a serious injury, illness or death, it is not unusual to experience acute stress. Sometimes, people who have given \ufb01 rst aid or performed CPR in these situations feel that they are unable to cope with the stress. This feeling is known as incident stress . If not appropriately managed, this acute stress may lead to a serious condition called post-traumatic stress disorder. Signals of Incident Stress Reactions Some effects may appear right away whereas others may take longer to develop. Signals of incident stress include: Anxiousness and inability to sleep. \u25a0 Nightmares. \u25a0 Restlessness and other problems. \u25a0 Confusion. \u25a0 Lower attention span. \u25a0 Poor concentration. \u25a0 Denial. \u25a0 Guilt. \u25a0 Depression. \u25a0 Anger. \u25a0 Nausea. \u25a0 Change in interactions with others. \u25a0 Increased or decreased eating. \u25a0 FIGURE 1-29 An infant recovery position FIGURE 1-28, A\u2013B A , Placing a person in a modi\ufb01 ed H.A.IN.E.S. recovery position.

Every day in U.S. homes, parks and workplaces someone will have a heart attack or go into cardiac arrest. Recognizing the signals of a heart attack and cardiac arrest, calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and giving immediate care in a cardiac emergency saves lives. Performing CPR and using an automated external de\ufb01 brillator (AED) immediately after a person goes into cardiac arrest can greatly increase his or her chance of survival. In this chapter you will \ufb01 nd out what signals to look for if you suspect a person is having a heart attack or has gone into cardiac arrest. This chapter also discusses how to care for a person having a heart attack and how to perform CPR for a person in cardiac arrest. In addition, this chapter covers the important links in the Cardiac Chain of Survival. Although cardiac emergencies occur more commonly in adults, they also occur in infants and children. This chapter discusses the causes of cardiac arrest and how to provide care for all age groups. ",
                "30": "BACKGROUND The heart is a fascinating organ. It beats more than 3 billion times in an average lifetime. The heart is about the size of a \ufb01 st and lies between the lungs in the middle of the chest. It pumps blood throughout the body. The ribs, breastbone and spine protect it from injury. The heart is separated into right and left halves (Fig. 2-1). Blood that contains little or no oxygen enters the right side of the heart and is pumped to the lungs. The blood picks up oxygen in the lungs when you breathe. The oxygen-rich blood then goes to the left side of the heart and is pumped from the heart\u2019s blood vessels, called the arteries , to all other parts of the body. The heart and your body\u2019s vital organs need this constant supply of oxygen-rich blood. Cardiovascular disease is an abnormal condition that affects the heart and blood vessels. An estimated 80 million Americans suffer from some form of the disease. It remains the number one killer in the United States and is a major cause of disability. The most common conditions caused by cardiovascular disease include coronary heart disease , also known as coronary artery disease , and stroke, also called a brain attack . Coronary heart disease occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle harden and narrow. This process is called atherosclerosis . The damage occurs gradually, as cholesterol and fatty deposits called plaque build up on the inner artery walls (Fig. 2-2). As this build-up worsens, the arteries become narrower. This reduces the amount of blood that can \ufb02 ow through them and prevents the heart from getting the blood and oxygen it needs. If the heart does not get blood containing oxygen, it will not work properly. Coronary heart disease accounts for about half of the greater than 800,000 adults who die each year from cardiovascular disease. When the heart is working normally, it beats evenly and easily, with a steady rhythm. When damage to the heart causes it to stop working effectively, a person can experience a heart attack or other damage to the heart muscle. A heart attack can cause the heart to beat in an irregular way. This may prevent blood from circulating effectively. When the heart does not work properly, normal breathing can be disrupted or stopped. A heart attack also can cause the heart to stop beating entirely. This condition is called cardiac arrest . The number one cause of heart attack and cardiac arrest in adults is coronary heart disease. Other signi\ufb01 cant causes of cardiac arrest are non-heart related (e.g., poisoning or drowning). HEART ATTACK When blood \ufb02 ow to the heart muscle is reduced, people experience chest pain. This reduced blood \ufb02 ow usually is caused by coronary heart disease. When the blood and oxygen supply to the heart is reduced, a heart attack may result. FIGURE 2-1 The heart is separated into right and left halves. Blood that contains little or no oxygen enters the right side of the heart and is pumped to the lungs. The blood picks up oxygen in the lungs when you breathe. The oxygen-rich blood then goes to the left side of the heart and is pumped to all parts of the body.

                "31": "Cardiac Emergencies and CPR 31 What to Look For A heart attack can be indicated by common signals. Even people who have had a heart attack may not recognize the signals, because each heart attack may not show the same signals. You should be able to recognize the following signals of a heart attack so that you can give prompt and proper care: Chest pain, discomfort or pressure \u25a0 . The most common signal is persistent pain, discomfort or pressure in the chest that lasts longer than 3 to 5 minutes or goes away and comes back. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to distinguish heart attack pain from the pain of indigestion, muscle spasms or other conditions. This often causes people to delay getting medical care. Brief, stabbing pain or pain that gets worse when you bend or breathe deeply usually is not caused by a heart problem. The pain associated with a heart attack can range \u0002 from discomfort to an unbearable crushing sensation in the chest. The person may describe it as pressure, squeezing, \u0002 tightness, aching or heaviness in the chest. Many heart attacks start slowly as mild pain \u0002 or discomfort. Often the person feels pain or discomfort in the \u0002 center of the chest (Fig. 2-3). The pain or discomfort becomes constant. \u0002 It usually is not relieved by resting, changing position or taking medicine. Some individuals may show no signals at all. \u0002 Discomfort in other areas of the upper body in \u25a0 addition to the chest . Discomfort, pain or pressure may also be felt in or spread to the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, stomach or back. Trouble breathing \u25a0 . Another signal of a heart attack is trouble breathing. The person may be breathing faster than normal because the body tries to get the much-needed oxygen to the heart. The person may have noisy breathing or shortness of breath. Other signals. \u25a0 The person\u2019s skin may be pale or ashen (gray), especially around the face. Some people suffering from a heart attack may be damp with sweat or may sweat heavily, feel dizzy, become nauseous or vomit. They may become fatigued, lightheaded or lose consciousness. These signals are caused by the stress put on the body when the heart does not work as it should. Some individuals may show no signals at all. Differences in signals between men and women \u25a0 . Both men and women experience the most common signal for a heart attack: chest pain or discomfort. However, it is important to note that women are somewhat more likely to experience some of the other warning signals, particularly shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, back or jaw pain and unexplained fatigue or malaise. When they do experience chest pain, women may have a greater tendency to have atypical chest pain: sudden, sharp but short-lived pain outside of the breastbone. When to Call 9-1-1 Remember, the key signal of a heart attack is persistent chest pain or discomfort that lasts more than 3 to 5 minutes or goes away and comes back. If you suspect the person is having a heart attack based on his or her signals, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. A person having a heart attack probably will deny that any signal is serious. Do not let this in\ufb02 uence you. If you think the person might be having a heart attack, act quickly. What to Do Until Help Arrives It is important to recognize the signals of a heart attack and to act on those signals. Any heart attack might lead to cardiac arrest, but prompt action may prevent further damage to the heart. A person suffering from a heart attack, and whose heart is still beating, has a far better chance of living than does a person whose heart has stopped. Most people who die of a heart attack die within 2 hours of the \ufb01 rst signal. Many could have been saved if people on the scene or the person having the heart attack had been aware of the signals and acted promptly. Many people who have heart attacks delay seeking care. Nearly half of all heart attack victims wait for 2 hours or more before going to the hospital. Often they do not realize they are having a heart attack. They may say the signals are just muscle soreness, indigestion or heartburn. FIGURE 2-3 Heart attack pain or pressure is often felt in the center of the chest. It may spread to the shoulder, arm, neck or jaw. ",
                "32": "Early treatment with certain medications\u2014including aspirin\u2014can help minimize damage to the heart after a heart attack. To be most effective, these medications need to be given within 1 hour of the start of heart attack signals. If you suspect that someone might be having a heart attack, you should: Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. \u25a0 Have the person stop what he or she is doing and rest \u25a0 comfortably (Fig. 2-4). This will ease the heart\u2019s need for oxygen. Many people experiencing a heart attack \ufb01 nd it easier to breathe while sitting. Loosen any tight or uncomfortable clothing. \u25a0 Closely watch the person until advanced medical \u25a0 personnel take over. Notice any changes in the person\u2019s appearance or behavior. Monitor the person\u2019s condition. Be prepared to perform CPR and use an AED, if \u25a0 available, if the person loses consciousness and stops breathing. Ask the person if he or she has a history of heart \u25a0 disease. Some people with heart disease take prescribed medication for chest pain. You can help by getting the medication for the person and assisting him or her with taking the prescribed medication. Offer aspirin, if med i cally appropriate and local \u25a0 protocols allow, and if the patient can swallow and has no known contraindications (see the following section). Be sure that the person has not been FOCUS ON PREVENTION CORONARY HEART DISEASE Recognizing a heart attack and getting the necessary care at once may prevent a person from going into cardiac arrest. However, preventing a heart attack in the \ufb01 rst place is even more effective. There is no substitute for prevention. Heart attacks usually result from disease of the heart and blood vessels. Although a heart attack may seem to strike suddenly, many people\u2019s lifestyles are gradually putting their hearts in danger. Because coronary heart disease develops slowly, some individuals may not be aware of it for many years. Fortunately, it is possible to slow the progression of the disease by making lifestyle changes. Many things increase a person\u2019s chances of developing coronary heart disease. These are called risk factors. Some of them cannot be changed. For instance, although more women than men die each year from coronary heart disease in the United States, heart disease generally affects men at younger ages than it does women. Besides gender, ethnicity also plays an important role in determining the risk for heart disease. African Americans and Native Americans have higher rates of heart disease than do other U.S. populations. A family history of heart disease also increases your risk. Reducing Risk Factors There are some risk factors that can be reduced. Cigarette smoking, a poor diet, uncontrolled high blood cholesterol or high blood pressure, being overweight and lack of regular exercise all increase your risk of heart disease. When you combine one risk factor, like smoking, with others, such as high blood pressure and lack of exercise, your risk of heart attack is much greater. By taking steps to control your risk factors, you can improve your chances for living a long and healthy life. Remember, it is never too late. The best way to deal with a heart attack or cardiac arrest is to prevent it. Begin to reduce your risk of heart disease today. FIGURE 2-4 Comforting the person helps to reduce anxiety and eases some of the discomfort. ",
                "33": "Cardiac Emergencies and CPR 33 told by his or her health care provider to avoid taking aspirin. Be calm and reassuring. Comforting the person helps \u25a0 to reduce anxiety and eases some of the discomfort. Talk to bystanders and if possible the person to get \u25a0 more information. Do not try to drive the person to the hospital yourself. \u25a0 He or she could quickly get worse on the way. Giving Aspirin to Lessen Heart Attack Damage You may be able to help a conscious person who is showing early signals of a heart attack by offering him or her an appropriate dose of aspirin when the signals \ufb01 rst begin. However, you should never delay calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number to do this. Always call for help as soon as you recognize the signals of a heart attack. Then help the person to be comfortable before you give the aspirin. If the person is able to take medicine by mouth, ask: Are you allergic to aspirin? \u25a0 Do you have a stomach ulcer or stomach disease? \u25a0 Are you taking any blood thinners, such as warfarin \u25a0 (Coumadin\u2122)? Have you ever been told by a doctor to avoid \u25a0 taking aspirin? If the person answers no to all of these questions, you may offer him or her two chewable (81 mg each) baby aspirins, or one 5-grain (325 mg) adult aspirin tablet with a small amount of water. Do not use coated aspirin products or products meant for multiple uses such as for cold, fever and headache. You also may offer these doses of aspirin if the person regains consciousness while you are giving care and is able to take the aspirin by mouth. Be sure that you offer only aspirin and not Tylenol \u00ae , acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02 ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, Motrin \u00ae , Advil \u00ae , naproxen and Aleve \u00ae . CARDIAC ARREST Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or beats too ineffectively to circulate blood to the brain and other vital organs. The beats, or contractions, of the heart become ineffective if they are weak, irregular or uncoordinated, because at that point the blood no longer \ufb02 ows through the arteries to the rest of the body. When the heart stops beating properly, the body cannot survive. Breathing will soon stop, and the body\u2019s organs will no longer receive the oxygen they need to function. Without oxygen, brain damage can begin in about 4 to 6 minutes, and the damage can become irreversible after about 10 minutes. A person in cardiac arrest is unconscious, not breathing and has no heartbeat. The heart has either stopped beating or is beating weakly and irregularly so that a pulse cannot be detected. Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of cardiac arrest in adults. Cardiac arrest also results from drowning, choking, drug abuse, severe injury, brain damage and electrocution. Causes of cardiac arrest in children and infants include airway and breathing problems, traumatic injury, a hard blow to the chest, congenital heart disease and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Cardiac arrest can happen suddenly, without any of the warning signs usually seen in a heart attack. This is known as sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death and accounts for more than 300,000 deaths annually in the United States. Sudden cardiac arrest is caused by abnormal, chaotic electrical activity of the heart (known as arrhythmias ). The most common life-threatening abnormal arrhythmia is ventricular \ufb01 brillation (V-\ufb01 b). Cardiac Chain of Survival CPR alone may not be enough to help someone survive cardiac arrest. Advanced medical care is needed as soon as possible. A person in cardiac arrest will have the greatest chance of survival if you follow the four links in the Cardiac Chain of Survival: 1. Early recognition and early access to the emergency medical services (EMS) system. The sooner someone calls 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, the sooner EMS personnel will take over. 2. Early CPR. CPR helps supply blood containing oxygen to the brain and other vital organs. This helps to keep the person alive until an AED is used or advanced medical care is provided. 3. Early de\ufb01 brillation. An electrical shock, called de\ufb01 brillation, may help to restore an effective heart rhythm. 4. Early advanced medical care. EMS personnel provide more advanced medical care and transport the person to a hospital. For each minute that CPR and de\ufb01 brillation are delayed, the chance for survival is reduced by about 10 percent. In the Cardiac Chain of Survival, each link of the chain depends on, and is connected to, the other links. Taking quick action by calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, starting CPR immediately and using an AED, if one is available, makes it more likely that a person in cardiac arrest will survive. Remember, you are the ",
                "34": "rst link in the Cardiac Chain of Survival. By acting quickly, you can make a positive difference for someone experiencing a cardiac emergency. What to Look For The main signals of cardiac arrest in an adult, a child and an infant are unconsciousness and no breathing. The presence of these signals means that no blood and oxygen are reaching the person\u2019s brain and other vital organs. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately if you suspect that a person is in cardiac arrest or you witness someone suddenly collapse. What to Do Until Help Arrives Perform CPR until an AED is available and ready to use or advanced medical personnel take over. Early CPR and De\ufb01 brillation A person in cardiac arrest needs immediate CPR and de\ufb01 brillation. The cells of the brain and other important organs continue to live for a short time\u2014until all of the oxygen in the blood is used. CPR is a combination of chest compressions and rescue breaths. When the heart is not beating, chest compressions are needed to circulate blood containing oxygen. Given together, rescue breaths and chest compressions help to take over for the heart and lungs. CPR increases the chances of survival for a person in cardiac arrest. In many cases, however, CPR alone cannot correct the underlying heart problem: de\ufb01 brillation delivered by an AED is needed. This shock disrupts the heart\u2019s electrical activity long enough to allow the heart to spontaneously develop an effective rhythm on its own. Without early CPR and early de\ufb01 brillation, the chances of survival are greatly reduced. (Using an AED is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.) CPR for Adults To determine if an unconscious adult needs CPR, follow the emergency action steps ( CHECK\u2014CALL\u2014CARE ) that you learned in Chapter 1. CHECK \u25a0 the scene and the injured or ill person. CALL \u25a0 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. CHECK \u25a0 for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. Quickly \u25a0 CHECK for severe bleeding. If the person is not breathing, give \u25a0 CARE by beginning CPR. For chest compressions to be the most effective, the person should be on his or her back on a \ufb01 rm, \ufb02 at surface. If the person is on a soft surface like a sofa or bed, quickly move him or her to a \ufb01 rm, \ufb02 at surface before you begin. To perform CPR on an adult: Position your body correctly by kneeling beside \u25a0 the person\u2019s upper chest, placing your hands in the correct position, and keeping your arms and elbows as straight as possible so that your shoulders are directly over your hands (Fig. 2-5). Your body position is important when giving chest compressions. Compressing the person\u2019s chest straight down will help you reach the necessary depth. Using the correct body position also will be less tiring for you. Locate the correct hand position by placing the heel \u25a0 of one hand on the person\u2019s sternum (breastbone) at the center of his or her chest (Fig. 2-6). Place FIGURE 2-5 Position yourself so that your shoulders are directly over your hands. FIGURE 2-6 Locate the correct hand position by placing the heel of one hand on the person\u2019s sternum (breastbone) in the center of the person\u2019s chest. ",
                "35": "Cardiac Emergencies and CPR 35 FIGURE 2-8 If you have arthritis in your hands, you can give compressions by grasping the wrist of the hand positioned on the chest with your other hand. Give 30 chest compressions. Push hard, push fast \u25a0 at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute. Note that the term \u201c100 compressions per minute\u201d refers to the speed of compressions, not the number of compressions given in a minute. As you give compressions, count out loud, \u201cOne and two and three and four and \ufb01 ve and six and\u2026\u201d up to 30. Push down as you say the number and come up as you say \u201cand.\u201d This will help you to keep a steady, even rhythm. Give compressions by pushing the sternum \u25a0 down at least 2 inches (Fig. 2-9, A). The downward and upward movement should be smooth, not jerky. Push straight down with the weight of your upper body, not with your arm muscles. This way, the weight of your upper body will create the force needed to compress the chest. Do not rock back and forth. Rocking results in less-effective compressions and wastes much- needed energy. If your arms and shoulders tire quickly, you are not using the correct body position. After each compression, release the pressure on \u25a0 the chest without removing your hands or changing hand position (Fig. 2-9, B). Allow the chest to return to its normal position before starting the next compression. Maintain a steady down-and-up rhythm and do not pause between compressions. Spend half of the time pushing down and half of the time coming up. When you press down, the walls of the heart squeeze together, forcing the blood to empty out of the heart. When you come up, you should release all pressure on the chest, but do not take hands off the chest. This allows the heart\u2019s chambers to \ufb01 ll with blood between compressions. your other hand directly on top of the \ufb01 rst hand and try to keep your \ufb01 ngers off of the chest by interlacing them or holding them upward (Fig. 2-7). If you feel the notch at the end of the sternum, move your hands slightly toward the person\u2019s head. If you have arthritis in your hands, you can give compressions by grasping the wrist of the hand positioned on the chest with your other hand (Fig. 2-8). The person\u2019s clothing should not interfere with \ufb01 nding the proper hand position or your ability to give effective compressions. If it does, loosen or remove enough clothing to allow deep compressions in the center of the person\u2019s chest. FIGURE 2-9, A\u2013B To give chest compressions: A , Push straight down with the weight of your body. B, Release, allowing the chest to return to its normal position.

                "36": "Once you have given 30 compressions, open the \u25a0 airway using the head-tilt/chin-lift technique and give 2 rescue breaths. Each rescue breath should last about 1 second and make the chest clearly rise. Open the airway and give rescue breaths, one \u0002 after the other. Tilt the head back and lift the chin up. \u0002 Pinch the nose shut then make a complete seal \u0002 over the person\u2019s mouth. Blow in for about 1 second to make the chest \u0002 clearly rise. Continue cycles of chest compressions and rescue \u25a0 breaths. Each cycle of chest compressions and rescue breaths should take about 24 seconds. Minimize the interruption of chest compressions. If Two Responders Are Available If two responders trained in CPR are at the scene, both should identify themselves as being trained. One should call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help while the other performs CPR. If the \ufb01 rst responder is tired and needs help: The \ufb01 rst responder should tell the second responder \u25a0 to take over. The second responder should immediately take over \u25a0 CPR, beginning with chest compressions. When to Stop CPR Once you begin CPR, do not stop except in one of these situations: You notice an obvious sign of life, such as \u25a0 breathing. An AED is available and ready to use. \u25a0 Another trained responder or EMS personnel take \u25a0 over (Fig. 2-10). You are too exhausted to continue. \u25a0 The scene becomes unsafe. \u25a0 If at any time you notice that the person is breathing, stop CPR. Keep his or her airway open and continue to monitor the person\u2019s breathing and for any changes in the person\u2019s condition until EMS personnel take over (Fig. 2-11). Cardiac Emergencies in Children and Infants It is rare for a child or an infant to initially suffer a cardiac emergency. Usually, a child or an infant has a respiratory emergency \ufb01 rst and then a cardiac emergency develops. Causes of cardiac arrest in children and infants include: Airway and breathing problems. \u25a0 Traumatic injury or an accident (e.g., motor-vehicle \u25a0 collision, drowning, electrocution or poisoning). A hard blow to the chest. \u25a0 Congenital heart disease. \u25a0 Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). \u25a0 If you recognize that a child or an infant is not breathing, begin CPR. CPR for Children and Infants Follow the emergency action steps ( CHECK\u2014 CALL\u2014CARE ) to determine if you will need to perform CPR for a child or an infant. The principles of CPR (compressing the chest and giving rescue breaths) are the same for children and infants as for adults. However, the CPR techniques are slightly different since children\u2019s and infants\u2019 bodies are smaller.

                "37": "Cardiac Emergencies and CPR 37 FOCUS ON PREPAREDNESS Your 85-year-old grand father is living with your family. He has a terminal illness and is frequently in the hospital. One afternoon, you go to his room to give him lunch. As you start to talk to him, you realize that he is unconscious. You check for breathing. He is not breathing. What should you do? No one but you can answer that question. No one can advise you. No one can predict the outcome of your decision. You alone must decide whether or not to give your grandfather CPR. Endless questions race through your mind. Can I face the fact I am losing someone I love? Should I always try to perform CPR? What would his life be like after resuscitation? What would my grand father want? Your mind tells you to perform CPR, yet your heart says no. It is important to realize that it is okay to withhold CPR when a terminally ill person is dying. Nature takes its course, and in some cases people feel they have lived full lives and are prepared for death. Advance Directives Fortunately, this type of heart-wrenching, last-second decision sometimes can be avoided if loved ones talk to each other in advance about their preferences regarding lifesaving treatments. Instructions that describe a person\u2019s wishes about medical treatment are called advance directives. These instructions make known a person\u2019s intentions while he or she is still capable of doing so and are used when the person can no longer make his or her own health-care decisions. As provided by the Federal Patient Self-Determination Act, adults who are admitted to a hospital or a health- care facility or who receive assistance from certain organizations that receive funds from Medicare and Medicaid have the right to make fundamental choices about their own care. They must be told about their right to make decisions about the level of life support that would be provided in an emergency situation. They are supposed to be offered the opportunity to make these choices at the time of admission. Conversations with relatives, friends or health care providers while the person is still capable of making decisions are the most common form of advance directives. However, because conversations may not be recalled accurately or may not have taken into account the illness or emergency now facing the person, the courts consider written directives to be more reliable. Two examples of written advance directives are living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care. The types of health-care decisions covered by these documents vary by state. Talking with a legal professional can help to determine which advance directive options are available in your state and what they cover. If a person establishes a living will, directions for health care would be in place before he or she became unable to communicate his or her wishes. Instructions that can be included in this document vary from state to state. A living will generally allows a person to refuse only medical care that \u201cmerely prolongs the process of dying,\u201d such as resuscitating a person with a terminal illness. If a person has established a durable power of attorney for health care, the document would authorize someone else to make medical decisions for that person in any situation in which the person could no longer make them for him- or herself. This authorized person is called a health care surrogate or proxy. This surrogate, with the information given by the person\u2019s health care provider, may consent to or refuse medical treatment on the person\u2019s behalf. Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Attempt Resuscitation A doctor could formalize the person\u2019s preferences by writing Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) or Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) orders in his or her medical records. Such orders would state that if the person\u2019s heart or breathing stops, he or she should not be resuscitated. DNR/DNAR orders may be covered in a living will or in the durable power of attorney for health care. ADVANCE DIRECTIVES ( Continued ) ",

Some of these documents can be obtained through a personal physician, attorney or various state and health care organizations. A lawyer is not always needed to execute advance directives. However, if you have any questions concerning advance directives, it is wise to obtain legal advice. Talk in Advance Copies of advance directives should be provided to all personal physicians, family members and the person chosen as the health care surrogate. Tell them which documents have been prepared and where the original and other copies are located. Discuss the document with all parties so that they understand the intent of all requests. Keep these documents updated. Keep in mind that advance directives are not limited to elderly people or people with terminal illnesses. Advance directives should be considered by anyone who has decided on the care he or she would like to have provided. An unexpected injury or illness could create a need for decisions at any time. Knowing about living wills, durable powers of attorney for health care and DNR/DNAR orders can help you prepare for dif\ufb01 cult decisions.

                "46": "WHEN THE HEART SUDDENLY FAILS The heart\u2019s electrical system sends out signals that tell the heart to pump blood. These signals travel through the upper chambers of the heart, called the atria , to the lower chambers, called the ventricles . When the heart is normal and healthy, these electrical signals cause the ventricles to squeeze together, or contract. These contractions force blood out of the heart. The blood then circulates throughout the body. When the ventricles relax between contractions, blood \ufb02 ows back into the heart. The pause that you notice between heart beats when taking a person\u2019s pulse are the pauses between contractions. If the heart is damaged by disease or injury, its electrical system can be disrupted. This can cause an abnormal heart rhythm that can stop the blood from circulating. The most common abnormal heart rhythm that causes sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the ventricles simply quiver, or \ufb01 brillate , without any organized rhythm. This condition is called ventricular \ufb01 brillation (V-\ufb01 b). In V-\ufb01 b, the electrical impulses \ufb01 re at random, creating chaos and preventing the heart from pumping and circulating blood. The person may suddenly collapse unconscious, and stop breathing. Another abnormal rhythm found during sudden cardiac arrest is ventricular tachycardia , or V-tach. With V-tach, the electrical system tells the ventricles to contract too quickly. As a result, the heart cannot pump blood properly. As with V-\ufb01 b, during V-tach the person may collapse, become unconscious and stop breathing. In many cases, V-\ufb01 b and V-tach can be corrected by an electrical shock delivered by an AED. AEDs are portable electronic devices that analyze the heart\u2019s rhythm and deliver an electrical shock, known as de\ufb01 brillation , which helps the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm (Fig. 3-1). For each minute that CPR and de\ufb01 brillation are delayed, the person\u2019s chance for survival is reduced by about 10 percent. However, by learning how to perform CPR and use an AED, you can make a difference before EMS personnel take over. USING AN AED When a cardiac arrest in an adult occurs, call 9-1-1 or local emergency number and begin CPR immediately. Also, use an AED as soon as it is available and ready to use (Fig. 3-2). If CPR is in progress, do not interrupt until the AED is turned on and the de\ufb01 brillation pads are applied. Always follow local protocols , which are guidelines provided by the facility\u2019s medical director or EMS system, when using an AED. Be thoroughly familiar with the manufacturer\u2019s operating instructions. Also, be familiar with maintenance guidelines for the device that you will be using. AED PRECAUTIONS When operating an AED, follow these general precautions: \u25a0 Do not use alcohol to wipe the person\u2019s chest dry. Alcohol is \ufb02 ammable. \u25a0 Do not use an AED and/or pads designed for adults on a child younger than 8 years or weighing less than 55 pounds unless pediatric AED pads speci\ufb01 c to the device are not available. \u25a0 Do not use pediatric AED pads on an adult or on a child older than 8 years, or on a person weighing more than 55 pounds. AEDs equipped with pediatric AED pads deliver lower levels of energy that are considered appropriate only for children FIGURE 3-1 There are several types of AEDs.

Touching or moving the person may affect analysis. \u25a0 Before shocking a person with an AED, make sure that no one is touching or is in contact with the person or any resuscitation equipment. \u25a0 Do not touch the person while the device is de\ufb01 brillating. You or someone else could be shocked. \u25a0 Do not de\ufb01 brillate someone when around \ufb02 ammable or combustible materials, such as gasoline or free-\ufb02 owing oxygen. \u25a0 Do not use an AED in a moving vehicle. Movement may affect the analysis. \u25a0 The person should not be in a pool or puddle of water when the responder is operating an AED. \u25a0 Do not use an AED on a person wearing a nitroglycerin patch or other medical patch on the chest. With a gloved hand, remove any patches from the chest before attaching the device. \u25a0 Do not use a mobile phone or radio within 6 feet of the AED. Radiofrequency interference (RFI) and electromagnetic interference (EMI), as well as infrared interference, generated by radio signals can disrupt analysis. HOW TO USE AN AED\u2014ADULTS Different types of AEDs are available, but all are similar to operate and have some common features, such as electrode (AED or defibrillation) pads, voice prompts, visual displays and/or lighted buttons to guide the responder through the steps of the AED operation. Most AEDs can be operated by following these simple steps: \u25a0 Turn on the AED. \u25a0 Expose the person\u2019s chest and wipe the bare chest dry with a small towel or gauze pads. This ensures that the AED pads will stick to the chest properly. \u25a0 Apply the AED pads to the person\u2019s bare, dry chest. (Make sure to peel the backing off each pad, one at a time, to expose the adhesive surface of the pad before applying it to  the person\u2019s bare chest.) Place one pad on the upper right chest and the other pad on the left side of the chest (Fig. 3-3, A). \u25a0 Plug the connector into the AED, if necessary. \u25a0 Let the AED analyze the heart rhythm (or push the button marked \u201canalyze,\u201d if indicated and prompted by the AED). Advise all responders and bystanders to \u201cstand clear\u201d (Fig. 3-3, B). No one should touch the person while the AED is analyzing because this could result in faulty readings. \u25a0 If the AED advises that a shock is needed: { Make sure that no one, including you, is touching the person. { Say, \u201cEVERYONE, STAND CLEAR.\u201d { Deliver the shock by pushing the \u201cshock\u201d button, if necessary. (Some models can deliver the shock automatically while others have a \u201cshock\u201d button that must be manually pushed to deliver the shock.) \u25a0 After delivering the shock, or if no shock is advised: { Perform about 2 minutes (or 5 cycles) of CPR. { Continue to follow the prompts of the AED. If at any time you notice an obvious sign of life, such as breathing, stop performing CPR and monitor the person\u2019s breathing and any changes in the person\u2019s condition.

                "48": "HOW TO USE AN AED\u2014 CHILDREN AND INFANTS While the incidence of cardiac arrest is relatively low compared with adults, sudden cardiac arrest resulting from V-\ufb01 b does happen to young children and infants. However, most cases of cardiac arrest in children and infants are not sudden and may be caused by: \u25a0 Airway and breathing problems. \u25a0 Traumatic injuries or accidents (e.g., motor-vehicle collision, drowning, electrocution or poisoning). \u25a0 A hard blow to the chest. \u25a0 Congenital heart disease. \u25a0 Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Use an AED as soon as it is available, ready to use and is safe to do so. However, as you learned in the Cardiac Chain of Survival, in a cardiac emergency, you should always call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number \ufb01 rst. AEDs equipped with pediatric AED pads can deliver lower levels of energy considered appropriate for children and infants up to 8 years of age or weighing less than 55 pounds. Use pediatric AED pads and/or equipment if available. If pediatric-speci\ufb01 c equipment is not available, use an AED designed for adults on children and infants. Always follow local protocols (i.e., guidelines provided by the facility\u2019s medical director or EMS) and the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Follow the same general steps and precautions that you would when using an AED on an adult in cardiac arrest. \u25a0 Turn on the AED. \u25a0 Expose the child\u2019s or infant\u2019s chest and wipe it dry. \u25a0 Apply the pediatric pads to the child\u2019s or infant\u2019s bare, dry chest. Place one pad on the child\u2019s upper right chest and the other pad on the left side of the chest. Make sure that the pads are not touching. If the pads risk touching each other, such as with a small child or an infant, place one pad in the middle of the child\u2019s or infant\u2019s chest and the other pad on the child\u2019s or infant\u2019s back, between the shoulder blades (Fig. 3-4, A\u2013B). \u25a0 Plug the connector into the AED, if necessary. \u25a0 Let the AED analyze the heart rhythm (or push the button marked \u201canalyze,\u201d if indicated and prompted by the AED). Advise all responders and bystanders to \u201cStand clear.\u201d No one should touch the child or infant while the AED is analyzing because this could result in faulty reading. \u25a0 If the AED advises that a shock is needed: { Make sure that no one, including you, is touching the child or infant. { Say, \u201cEVERYONE, STAND CLEAR.\u201d { Deliver the shock by pushing the \u201cshock\u201d button, if necessary. \u25a0 After delivering the shock, or if no shock is advised: { Perform about 2 minutes (or 5 cycles) of CPR. { Continue to follow the prompts of the AED. If at any time you notice an obvious sign of life, such as breathing, stop performing CPR and monitor breathing and for any changes in the child\u2019s or infant\u2019s condition. SPECIAL AED SITUATIONS Some situations require you to pay special attention when using an AED. These include using AEDs around water and on people with implantable devices, transdermal patches, hypothermia, trauma and jewelry or body piercings. Or, you may need to determine what FIGURE 3-4, A\u2013B A, Place one pediatric pad on the upper right chest and the other pad on the left side of the chest. B, If the pads risk touching each other, place one on the chest and the other on the back of the child or infant. A B ",
                "49": "AED 49 to do if local protocols or the AED\u2019s instructions differ from those you have learned. Familiarize yourself with these situations as much as possible so that you know how to respond appropriately, should the situation arise. Always use common sense when using an AED and follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. AEDs Around Water If the person is in water, remove him or her from the water before de\ufb01 brillation. A shock delivered in water could harm responders or bystanders. Once you have removed the person from the water, be sure there are no puddles of water around you, the person or the AED. Remove wet clothing to place the pads properly, if necessary. Dry the person\u2019s chest and attach the AED pads. If it is raining, take steps to make sure that the person is as dry as possible and sheltered from the rain. Ensure that the person\u2019s chest is wiped dry. Do not delay de\ufb01 brillation when taking steps to create a dry environment. AEDs are safe when all precautions and manufacturer\u2019s operating instructions are followed, even in rain and snow. Avoid getting the AED or de\ufb01 brillation pads wet. Pacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter-De\ufb01 brillators Some people whose hearts are weak, beat too slowly, skip beats or beat in a rhythm that is too fast may have had a pacemaker implanted. These small, implantable devices are usually located in the area below the person\u2019s left collar bone, although they can be placed elsewhere. Typically they feel like a small lump under the skin. Other people may have an implantable cardio verter- de\ufb01 brillator (ICD), a miniature version of an AED. ICDs automatically recognize and restore abnormal heart rhythms. Sometimes a person\u2019s heart beats irregularly, even if the person has a pacemaker or ICD. If the implanted device is visible or you know that the person has one, do not place the de\ufb01 brillation pads directly over the device (Fig. 3-5). This may interfere with the delivery of the shock. Adjust pad placement if necessary and continue to follow the AED instructions. If you are not sure whether the person has an implanted device, use the AED if needed. It will not harm the person or responder. The responder should be aware that it is possible to receive a mild shock if an implantable ICD delivers a shock to the person during CPR. However, this risk of injury to responders is minimal, and the amount of electrical energy involved is low. Follow any special precautions associated with ICDs but do not delay in performing CPR and using an AED. Transdermal Medication Patches Some people have a patch on their skin that automatically delivers medication through the skin, called a transdermal medication patch . A common medication patch is the nitroglycerin patch, which is used by people with a history of cardiac problems. Because a responder can absorb medication through the skin, remove patches with a gloved hand before de\ufb01 brillation. Nicotine patches used to stop smoking look similar to nitroglycerin patches. Do not waste time trying to identify patches. Instead remove any patch that you see on the person\u2019s chest with a gloved hand. Never place AED electrode pads directly on top of medication patches. Hypothermia Hypothermia is a life-threatening condition in which the entire body cools because its ability to keep warm fails. Some people who have experienced hypothermia have been resuscitated successfully, even after prolonged exposure to the cold. If the person is not breathing, begin CPR until an AED becomes readily available. Follow local protocols as to whether you should use an AED in this situation. If the person is wet, remove wet clothing and dry his or her chest. Attach the AED pads. If a shock is indicated, deliver it, following the instructions of the AED. If the person still is not breathing, continue CPR and protect the person from further heat loss. Follow local protocols as to whether additional shocks should be delivered. Do not withhold CPR or de\ufb01 brillation to re-warm the person. Be careful not to unnecessarily shake a person who has experienced hypothermia as this could result in V-\ufb01 b. Trauma If a person is in cardiac arrest as a result of traumatic injuries, you still can use an AED. Administer de\ufb01 brillation according to local protocols.

                "50": "Chest Hair Some men have excessive chest hair that may interfere with AED pad-to-skin contact, although it\u2019s a rare occurrence. Since time is critical in a cardiac arrest situation and chest hair rarely interferes with pad adhesion, attach the pads and analyze the heart\u2019s rhythm as soon as possible. Press \ufb01 rmly on the pads to attach them to the person\u2019s chest. If you get a \u201ccheck pads\u201d or similar message from the AED, remove the pads and replace them with new ones. The pad adhesive may pull out some of the chest hair, which may solve the problem. If you continue to get the \u201ccheck pads\u201d message, remove the pads, shave the person\u2019s chest where the pads should be placed, and attach new pads to the person\u2019s chest. (There should be spare de\ufb01 brillation pads and a safety razor included in the AED kit.) Be careful not to cut the person while shaving the chest, as cuts and scrapes can interfere with rhythm analysis. Metal Surfaces It is safe to deliver a shock to a person in cardiac arrest when he or she is lying on a metal surface, such as bleachers, as long as appropriate safety precautions are taken. Speci\ufb01 cally, care should be taken that de\ufb01 brillation electrode pads do not contact the conductive (metal) surface and that no one is touching the person when the shock button is pressed. Jewelry and Body Piercings You do not need to remove jewelry and body piercings when using an AED. Leaving them on the person will do no harm. Taking time to remove them will delay giving the \ufb01 rst shock. Therefore, do not delay the use of an AED to remove jewelry or body piercings. However, do not place the AED pads directly over metallic jewelry or body piercings. Adjust AED pad placement if necessary. OTHER AED PROTOCOLS Other AED protocols, such as delivering three shocks and then performing CPR, are neither wrong nor harmful to the person. However, improved methods, based on scienti\ufb01 c evidence, make it easier to coordinate performing CPR and using the AED. Follow the instructions of the AED device you are using. AED MAINTENANCE For de\ufb01 brillators to perform properly, they must be maintained like any other machine. AEDs require minimal maintenance. They have a variety of self- testing features. However, it is important to be familiar with any visual or audible warning prompts on the AED that warn of malfunction or a low battery. Read the operator\u2019s manual thoroughly and check with the manufacturer to obtain all necessary information regarding maintenance. In most cases, if the machine detects any malfunction, contact the manufacturer. You may need to return the device to the manufacturer for service. Although AEDs require minimal maintenance, it is important to remember the following: \u25a0 Follow the manufacturer\u2019s speci\ufb01 c recommendations and your facility\u2019s schedule for periodic equipment checks, including checking the batteries and de\ufb01 brillation pads. \u25a0 Make sure that the batteries have enough energy for one complete rescue. (A fully charged backup battery should be readily available.) \u25a0 Make sure that the correct de\ufb01 brillation pads are in the package and are properly sealed. \u25a0 Check any expiration dates on de\ufb01 brillation pads and batteries and replace as needed. \u25a0 After use, make sure that all accessories are replaced and that the machine is in proper working order. \u25a0 If at any time the machine fails to work properly or warning indicators are recognized, stop using it and contact the manufacturer immediately. If the AED stops working during an emergency continue performing CPR until EMS personnel take over. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Sudden cardiac arrest is a life-threatening emergency that happens when the heart suddenly stops beating or circulating blood because of abnormal electrical activity of the heart. You must act quickly to help. For a person to survive cardiac arrest, responders must recognize the cardiac emergency, call 9-1-1 immediately, perform CPR and use an AED as soon as one becomes available. These actions will keep blood containing oxygen \ufb02 owing throughout the body, stop the abnormal heart rhythm and ensure that advanced medical care arrives as quickly as possible. The sooner the EMS system is activated, CPR is started and a de\ufb01 brillation shock from an AED is delivered, the greater are the chances for survival. By following the four links of the Cardiac Chain of Survival you can help save a life. ",

This chapter discusses how to recognize and care for breathing emergencies. ",
                "56": "BACKGROUND The human body needs a constant supply of oxygen to survive. When you breathe through your mouth and nose, air travels down your throat, through your windpipe and into your lungs. This pathway from the mouth and nose to the lungs is called the airway . As you might imagine, the airway, mouth and nose are smaller in children and infants than they are in adults (Fig. 4-1, A\u2013B).  As a result, they can be blocked more easily by small objects, blood, \ufb02 uids or swelling. In a breathing emergency, air must reach the lungs. For any person, regardless of age, it is important to keep the airway open when giving care. Once air reaches the lungs, oxygen in the air is transferred to the blood. The heart pumps the blood throughout the body. The blood \ufb02 ows through the blood vessels, delivering oxygen to the brain, heart and all other parts of the body. In some breathing emergencies the oxygen supply to the body is greatly reduced, whereas in others the oxygen supply is cut off entirely. As a result, the heart soon stops beating and blood no longer moves through the body. Without oxygen, brain cells can begin to die within 4 to 6 minutes (Fig. 4-2). Unless the brain receives oxygen within minutes, permanent brain damage or death will result. It is important to recognize breathing emergencies in children and infants and act before the heart stops beating. Frequently, an adult\u2019s heart stops working (known as cardiac arrest ) because of heart disease. However, children and infants usually have healthy hearts. When the heart stops in a child or infant, it usually is the result of a breathing emergency. No matter what the age of the person, trouble breathing can be the \ufb01 rst signal of a more serious emergency, such as a heart problem. Recognizing the signals of breathing problems and giving care often are the keys to preventing these problems from becoming more serious emergencies. If the injured or ill person is conscious, he or she may be able to indicate what is wrong by speaking or gesturing to you and may be able to answer questions. However, if you are unable to communicate with a FIGURE 4-2 Time is critical in breathing emergencies.

                "57": "Breathing Emergencies 57 person, it can be dif\ufb01 cult to determine what is wrong. Therefore, it is important to recognize the signals of breathing emergencies, know when to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and know what to do until help arrives and takes over. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS AND RESPIRATORY ARREST Respiratory distress and respiratory arrest are types of breathing emergencies. Respiratory distress is a condition in which breathing becomes dif\ufb01 cult. It is the most common breathing emergency. Respiratory distress can lead to respiratory arrest , which occurs when breathing has stopped. Normal breathing is regular, quiet and effortless. A person does not appear to be working hard or struggling when breathing normally. This means that the person is not making noise when breathing, breaths are not fast and breathing does not cause discomfort or pain. However, it should be noted that normal breathing rates in children and infants are faster than normal breathing rates in adults. Infants have periodic breathing, so changes in breathing patterns are normal for infants. You usually can identify a breathing problem by watching and listening to the person\u2019s breathing and by asking the person how he or she feels. Causes of Respiratory Distress and Respiratory Arrest Respiratory distress and respiratory arrest can be caused by: \u25a0 Choking (a partially or completely obstructed airway). \u25a0 Illness. \u25a0 Chronic conditions (long-lasting or frequently recurring), such as asthma. \u25a0 Electrocution. \u25a0 Irregular heartbeat. \u25a0 Heart attack. \u25a0 Injury to the head or brain stem, chest, lungs or abdomen. \u25a0 Allergic reactions. \u25a0 Drug overdose (especially alcohol, narcotic painkillers, barbiturates, anesthetics and other depressants). \u25a0 Poisoning. \u25a0 Emotional distress. \u25a0 Drowning. Asthma Asthma is the in\ufb02 ammation of the air passages that results in a temporary narrowing of the airways that carry oxygen to the lungs. An asthma attack happens when a trigger, such as exercise, cold air, allergens or other irritants, causes the airway to swell and narrow. This makes breathing dif\ufb01 cult. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that in 2005, nearly 22.2 million Americans were affected by asthma. Asthma is more common in children and young adults than in older adults, but its frequency and severity is increasing in all age groups in the United States. Asthma is the third-ranking cause of hospitalization among those younger than 15 years. You often can tell when a person is having an asthma attack by the hoarse whistling sound that he or she makes while exhaling. This sound, known as wheezing , occurs because air becomes trapped in the lungs. Trouble breathing, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest and coughing after exercise are other signals of an asthma attack. Usually, people diagnosed with asthma prevent and control their attacks with medication. These medications reduce swelling and mucus production in the airways. They also relax the muscle bands that tighten around the airways, making breathing easier. For more information on asthma, see Chapter 10. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long-term lung disease encompassing both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD causes a person to have trouble breathing because of damage to the lungs. In a person with COPD, the airways become partly blocked and the air sacs in the lungs lose their ability to \ufb01 ll with air. This makes it hard to breathe in and out. There is no cure for COPD, and it worsens over time. The most common cause of COPD is cigarette smoking, but breathing in other types of lung irritants, pollution, dust or chemicals over a long period also can cause COPD. It usually is diagnosed when a person is middle aged or older. It is the fourth-ranking cause of death in the United States and a major cause of illness. Common signals of COPD include: \u25a0 Coughing up a large volume of mucus. \u25a0 Tendency to tire easily. \u25a0 Loss of appetite. \u25a0 Bent posture with shoulders raised and lips pursed to make breathing easier. \u25a0 A fast pulse. \u25a0 Round, barrel-shaped chest. \u25a0 Confusion (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain). ",
                "58": "Emphysema Emphysema is a type of COPD. Emphysema is a disease that involves damage to the air sacs in the lungs. It is a chronic (long-lasting or frequently recurring) disease that worsens over time. The most common signal of emphysema is shortness of breath. Exhaling is extremely dif\ufb01 cult. In advanced cases, the affected person may feel restless, confused and weak, and even may go into respiratory or cardiac arrest. Bronchitis Bronchitis is an in\ufb02 ammation of the main air passages to the lungs. It can be acute (short-lasting) or chronic. Chronic bronchitis is a type of COPD. To be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, a person must have a cough with mucus on most days of the month for at least 3 months. Acute bronchitis is not a type of COPD; it develops after a person has had a viral respiratory infection. It \ufb01 rst affects the nose, sinuses and throat and then spreads to the lungs. Those most at risk for acute bronchitis include children, infants, the elderly, people with heart or lung disease and smokers. Signals of both types of bronchitis include: \u25a0 Chest discomfort. \u25a0 Cough that produces mucus. \u25a0 Fatigue. \u25a0 Fever (usually low). \u25a0 Shortness of breath that worsens with activity. \u25a0 Wheezing. Additional signals of chronic bronchitis include: \u25a0 Ankle, feet and leg swelling. \u25a0 Blue lips. \u25a0 Frequent respiratory infections, such as colds or the \ufb02 u. Hyperventilation Hyperventilation occurs when a person\u2019s breathing is faster and more shallow than normal. When this happens, the body does not take in enough oxygen to meet its demands. People who are hyperventilating feel as if they cannot get enough air. Often they are afraid and anxious or seem confused. They may say that they feel dizzy or that their \ufb01 ngers and toes feel numb and tingly. Hyperventilation often results from fear or anxiety and usually occurs in people who are tense and nervous. However, it also can be caused by head injuries, severe bleeding or illnesses, such as high fever, heart failure, lung disease and diabetic emergencies. Asthma and exercise also can trigger hyperventilation. Hyperventilation is the body\u2019s way of compensating when there is a lack of enough oxygen. The result is a decrease in carbon dioxide, which alters the acidity of the blood. Allergic Reactions An allergic reaction is the response of the immune system to a foreign substance that enters the body. Common allergens include bee or insect venom, antibiotics, pollen, animal dander, sulfa and some foods such as nuts, peanuts, shell\ufb01 sh, strawberries and coconut oils. Allergic reactions can cause breathing problems. At \ufb01 rst the reaction may appear to be just a rash and a feeling of tightness in the chest and throat, but this condition can become life threatening. The person\u2019s face, neck and tongue may swell, closing the airway. A severe allergic reaction can cause a condition called anaphylaxis, also known as anaphylactic shock. During anaphylaxis, air passages swell and restrict a person\u2019s breathing. Anaphylaxis can be brought on when a person with an allergy comes into contact with allergens via insect stings, food, certain medications or other substances. Signals of anaphylaxis include a rash, tightness in the chest and throat, and swelling of the face, neck and tongue. The person also may feel dizzy or confused. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency. Some people know that they are allergic to certain substances or to insect stings. They may have learned to avoid these things and may carry medication to reverse the allergic reaction. People who have severe allergic reactions may wear a medical identi\ufb01 cation (ID) tag, bracelet or necklace. Croup Croup is a harsh, repetitive cough that most commonly affects children younger than 5 years. The airway constricts, limiting the passage of air, which causes the child to produce an unusual-sounding cough that can range from a high-pitched wheeze to a barking cough. Croup mostly occurs during the evening and nighttime. Most children with croup can be cared for at home using mist treatment or cool air. However, in some cases, a child with croup can progress quickly from respiratory distress to respiratory arrest. Epiglottitis Epiglottitis is a far less common infection than croup that causes severe swelling of the epiglottis. The epiglottis is a piece of cartilage at the back of the tongue. ",
                "59": "Breathing Emergencies 59 When it swells, it can block the windpipe and lead to severe breathing problems. Epiglottitis usually is caused by infection with Haemophilus in\ufb02 uenzae bacteria. The signals of epiglottitis may be similar to croup, but it is a more serious illness and can result in death if the airway is blocked completely. In the past, epiglottitis was a common illness in children between 2 and 6 years of age. However, epiglottitis in children has dropped dramatically in the United States since the 1980s when children began routinely receiving the H. in\ufb02 uenzae type B (Hib) vaccine. For children and adults, epiglottitis begins with a high fever and sore throat. A person with epiglottitis may need to sit up and lean forward, perhaps with the chin thrust out in order to breathe. Other signals include drooling, dif\ufb01 culty swallowing, voice changes, chills, shaking and fever. Seek medical care immediately for a person who may have epiglottitis. This condition is a medical emergency. What to Look For Although breathing problems have many causes, you do not need to know the exact cause of a breathing emergency to care for it. You do need to be able to recognize when a person is having trouble breathing or is not breathing at all. Signals of breathing emergencies include: \u25a0 Trouble breathing or no breathing. \u25a0 Slow or rapid breathing. \u25a0 Unusually deep or shallow breathing. \u25a0 Gasping for breath. \u25a0 Wheezing, gurgling or making high-pitched noises. \u25a0 Unusually moist or cool skin. \u25a0 Flushed, pale, ashen or bluish skin. \u25a0 Shortness of breath. \u25a0 Dizziness or light-headedness. \u25a0 Pain in the chest or tingling in the hands, feet or lips. \u25a0 Apprehensive or fearful feelings. When to Call 9-1-1 If a person is not breathing or if breathing is too fast, too slow, noisy or painful, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. What to Do Until Help Arrives If an adult, child or infant is having trouble breathing : \u25a0 Help the person rest in a comfortable position. Usually, sitting is more comfortable than lying down because breathing is easier in that position (Fig. 4-3). \u25a0 If the person is conscious, check for other conditions. \u25a0 Remember that a person having breathing problems may \ufb01 nd it hard to talk. If the person cannot talk, ask him or her to nod or to shake his or her head to answer yes-or-no questions. Try to reassure the person to reduce anxiety. This may make breathing easier. \u25a0 If bystanders are present and the person with trouble breathing is having dif\ufb01 culty answering your questions, ask them what they know about the person\u2019s condition. \u25a0 If the person is hyperventilating and you are sure whether it is caused by emotion, such as excitement or fear, tell the person to relax and breathe slowly. A person who is hyperventilating from emotion may resume normal breathing if he or she is reassured and calmed down. If the person\u2019s breathing still does not slow down, the person could have a serious problem. If an adult is unconscious and not breathing, the cause is most likely a cardiac emergency. Immediately begin CPR starting with chest compressions. If an adult is not breathing because of a respiratory cause, such as drowning, or drug overdose, give 2 rescue breaths after checking for breathing and before quickly scanning for severe bleeding and beginning CPR. Remember, a nonbreathing person\u2019s greatest need is for oxygen. If breathing stops or is restricted long enough, a person will become unconscious, the heart will stop beating and body systems will quickly fail. If a child or an infant is unconscious and not breathing , give 2 rescue breaths after checking for breathing and before quickly scanning for severe bleeding and beginning CPR. FIGURE 4-3 A person who is having trouble breathing may breathe more easily in a sitting position. ",
                "60": "CHOKING Choking is a common breathing emergency. It occurs when the person\u2019s airway is partially or completely blocked. If a conscious person is choking, his or her airway has been blocked by a foreign object, such as a piece of food or a small toy; by swelling in the mouth or throat; or by \ufb02 uids, such as vomit or blood. With a partially blocked airway, the person usually can breathe with some trouble. A person with a partially blocked airway may be able to get enough air in and out of the lungs to cough or to make wheezing sounds. The person also may get enough air to speak. A person whose airway is completely blocked cannot cough, speak, cry or breathe at all. Causes of Choking in Adults Causes of choking in an adult include: \u25a0 Trying to swallow large pieces of poorly chewed food. \u25a0 Drinking alcohol before or during meals. (Alcohol dulls the nerves that aid swallowing.) \u25a0 Wearing dentures. (Dentures make it dif\ufb01 cult to sense whether food is fully chewed before it is swallowed.) \u25a0 Eating while talking excitedly or laughing, or eating too fast. \u25a0 Walking, playing or running with food or objects in the mouth. Causes of Choking in Children and Infants Choking is a common cause of injury and death in children younger than 5 years. Because young children put nearly everything in their mouths, small, nonfood items, such as safety pins, small parts from toys and coins, often cause choking. However, food is responsible for most of the choking incidents in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that young children not be given hard, smooth foods such as raw vegetables. These foods must be chewed with a grinding motion, which is a skill that children do not master until 4 years of age; therefore, children may attempt to swallow these foods whole. For this same reason, the AAP recommends not giving children peanuts until they are 7 years of age or older. The AAP also recommends that young children not be given round, \ufb01 rm foods such as hot dogs and carrot sticks unless they are chopped into small pieces no larger than \u00bd inch. Since choking remains a signi\ufb01 cant danger to children younger than 5 years, the AAP further recommends keeping the following foods, and other items meant to be chewed or swallowed, away from young children: \u25a0 Hard, gooey or sticky candy \u25a0 Grapes \u25a0 Popcorn FOCUS ON PREVENTION CHOKING IN CHILDREN AND INFANTS \u25a0 Supervise mealtimes for young children and infants. \u25a0 Do not let children eat while playing or running. \u25a0 Teach children to chew and swallow food before talking or laughing. \u25a0 Do not give chewing gum to young children. \u25a0 Do not give young children smooth, hard food such as peanuts and raw vegetables. \u25a0 Do not give young children round, \ufb01 rm foods such as hot dogs and carrot sticks unless chopped into pieces \u00bd inch or smaller. \u25a0 Do not allow small children to play with un-in\ufb02 ated balloons. (The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends keeping these away from children younger than 8 years of age.) \u25a0 Keep small objects such as safety pins, small parts from toys and coins away from small children. \u25a0 Make sure that toys are too large to be swallowed. \u25a0 Make sure that toys have no small parts that could be pulled off. If you are unsure whether an object is safe for young children, test it by trying to pass it through a toilet paper roll. If it \ufb01 ts through the 1\u00be-inch diameter roll, it is not safe for young children. ",

Balloons, when broken or un-in\ufb02 ated, can choke or suffocate young children who try to swallow them. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), more children have suffocated on non-in\ufb02 ated balloons and pieces of broken balloons than any other type of toy. Other nonfood items that can cause choking include: \u25a0 Baby powder. \u25a0 Objects from the trash, such as eggshells and pop-tops from beverage cans. \u25a0 Safety pins. \u25a0 Coins. \u25a0 Marbles. \u25a0 Pen and marker caps. \u25a0 Small button-type batteries. What to Look For Signals of choking include: \u25a0 Coughing, either forcefully or weakly. \u25a0 Clutching the throat with one or both hands (Fig. 4-4). \u25a0 Inability to cough, speak, cry or breathe. \u25a0 Making high-pitched noises while inhaling or noisy breathing. \u25a0 Panic. \u25a0 Bluish skin color. \u25a0 Losing consciousness if blockage is not removed. When to Call 9-1-1 If the person continues to cough without coughing up the object, have someone call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. A partially blocked airway can quickly become completely blocked. FIGURE 4-4 Clutching the throat with one or both hands is universally recognized as a signal for choking.

Using too much force may cause internal injuries. A person who has choked and has been given back blows, abdominal thrusts and/or chest thrusts to clear the airway requires a medical evaluation. Internal injuries and damage to the airway may not be evident immediately. Special Situations in Caring for the Conscious Choking Adult or Child Special situations include: \u25a0 A large or pregnant person. If a conscious choking person is too large for you to reach around, is obviously pregnant or is known to be pregnant, give chest thrusts instead (Fig. 4-6). Chest thrusts A conscious adult or child who has a completely blocked airway needs immediate care. Using more than one technique often is necessary to dislodge an object and clear a person\u2019s airway. A combination of 5 back blows followed by 5 abdominal thrusts provides an effective way to clear the airway obstruction (Fig. 4-5, A\u2013D). To give back blows, position yourself slightly behind the person. Provide support by placing one arm diagonally across the chest and bend the person forward at the waist until the upper airway is at least parallel to the ground. Firmly strike the person between the shoulder blades with the heel of your other hand. To give abdominal thrusts to a conscious choking adult or child: \u25a0 Stand or kneel behind the person and wrap your arms around his or her waist. \u25a0 Locate the navel with one or two \ufb01 ngers of one hand.

                "69": "Sudden Illness 69 SUDDEN ILLNESS It usually is obvious when someone is injured and needs care. The person may be able to tell you what happened and what hurts. Checking the person also gives you clues about what might be wrong. However, when someone becomes suddenly ill, it is not as easy to tell what is physically wrong. At times, there are no signals to give clues about what is happening. At other times, the signals only con\ufb01 rm that something is wrong, without being clear as to what is wrong. In either case, the signals of a sudden illness often are confusing. You may \ufb01 nd it dif\ufb01 cult to determine if the person\u2019s condition is an emergency and whether to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. What to Look For When a person becomes suddenly ill, he or she usually looks and feels sick. Common signals include: \u25a0 Changes in level of consciousness, such as feeling lightheaded, dizzy, drowsy or confused, or becoming unconscious. \u25a0 Breathing problems (i.e., trouble breathing or no breathing). \u25a0 Signals of a possible heart attack, including persistent chest pain, discomfort or pressure lasting more than a few minutes that goes away and comes back or that spreads to the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, stomach or back. \u25a0 Signals of a stroke, including sudden weakness on one side of the face (facial droop); sudden weakness, often on one side of the body; sudden slurred speech or trouble forming words; or a sudden, severe headache. \u25a0 Loss of vision or blurred vision. \u25a0 Signals of shock, including rapid breathing, changes in skin appearance and cool, pale or ashen (grayish) skin. \u25a0 Sweating. \u25a0 Persistent abdominal pain or pressure. \u25a0 Nausea or vomiting. \u25a0 Diarrhea. \u25a0 Seizures. Look around the area for clues that might tell you what is wrong with the person. This may help you to \ufb01 nd out what the person was doing when the illness started. For example, if someone working in a hot environment suddenly becomes ill, it would make sense to conclude that the illness resulted from the heat. If someone suddenly feels ill or acts strangely and is attempting to take medication, the medication may be a clue as to what is wrong. For example, the person may need the medication for a heart condition and is trying to take it to avoid a medical emergency. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency for any of the following conditions: \u25a0 Unconsciousness or altered level of consciousness \u25a0 Breathing problems \u25a0 No breathing \u25a0 Chest pain, discomfort or pressure lasting more than 3 to 5 minutes that goes away and comes back or that radiates to the shoulder, arm, jaw, neck, stomach or back \u25a0 Persistent abdominal pain or pressure \u25a0 Severe external bleeding (bleeding that spurts or gushes steadily from a wound) \u25a0 Vomiting blood or passing blood \u25a0 Severe (critical) burns \u25a0 Suspected poisoning \u25a0 Seizures \u25a0 Stroke \u25a0 Suspected or obvious injuries to the head, neck or spine \u25a0 Painful, swollen, deformed areas (indicates possible broken bone) or an open fracture With some sudden illnesses, you might not be sure whether to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for help. Sometimes the signals come and go. Remember, if you cannot sort out the problem quickly and easily or if you have any doubts about the severity of the illness, make the call for help. What to Do Until Help Arrives Although you may not know the exact cause of the sudden illness, you should still give care. Initially you will care for the signals and not for any speci\ufb01 c condition. In the few cases in which you know that the person has a medical condition, such as diabetes, epilepsy or heart disease, the care you give may be slightly different. This care may involve helping the person take medication for his or her speci\ufb01 c illness. Care for sudden illnesses by following the same general guidelines as you would for any emergency. \u25a0 Do no further harm. \u25a0 Check the scene for safety, and then check the person. \u25a0 First care for life-threatening conditions such as unconsciousness; trouble breathing; no breathing; severe bleeding; severe chest pain; or signals of a stroke, such as weakness, numbness or trouble with speech. \u25a0 Help the person to rest comfortably. \u25a0 Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. \u25a0 Reassure the person because he or she may be anxious or frightened. \u25a0 Watch for changes in consciousness and breathing. ",
                "70": "If the person is conscious, ask if he or she has any medical conditions or is taking any medication. \u25a0 Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless he or she is fully conscious, is able to swallow and does not show any signals of a stroke. \u25a0 If the person vomits and is unconscious and lying down, position the person on his or her side so that you can clear the mouth. \u25a0 If you know the person is having a severe allergic reaction or a diabetic emergency, assist the person with his or her prescribed medication, if asked. SPECIFIC SUDDEN ILLNESSES Some sudden illnesses may be linked with chronic conditions. These conditions include degenerative diseases, such as heart and lung diseases. There may be a hormone imbalance, such as in diabetes. The person could have epilepsy, a condition that causes seizures. An allergy can cause a sudden and sometimes dangerous reaction to certain substances. When checking a person, look for a medical identi\ufb01 cation (ID) tag, bracelet, necklace or anklet indicating that the person has a chronic condition or allergy. Having to deal with a sudden illness can be frightening, especially when you do not know what is wrong. Do not hesitate to give care. Remember, you do not have to know the cause to help. Signals for sudden illnesses are similar to other conditions and the care probably involves skills that you already know. Fainting One common signal of sudden illness is a loss of consciousness, such as when a person faints. Fainting is a temporary loss of consciousness. When someone suddenly loses consciousness and then reawakens, he or she may simply have fainted. Fainting occurs when there is an insuf\ufb01 cient supply of blood to the brain for a short period of time. This condition results from a widening of the blood vessels in the body. This causes blood to drain away from the brain to the rest of the body. Fainting usually is not harmful. The person usually recovers quickly with no lasting effects. However, what appears to be a simple case of fainting actually may be a signal of a more serious condition. What to Look For A person who is about to faint often becomes pale, begins to sweat and then loses consciousness and collapses. A person who feels weak or dizzy may prevent a fainting spell by lying down or sitting with his or her head level with the knees. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number when in doubt about the condition of a person who has fainted. It is always appropriate to seek medical care for fainting. What to Do Until Help Arrives Lower the person to the ground or other \ufb02 at surface and position him or her on his or her back, lying \ufb02 at. Loosen any tight clothing, such as a tie or collar (Fig. 5-1). Check that the person is breathing. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink. If the person vomits, roll him or her onto one side. Seizures When the normal functions of the brain are disrupted by injury, disease, fever, infection, metabolic disturbances or conditions causing a decreased oxygen level, a seizure may occur. The seizure is a result of abnormal electrical activity in the brain and causes temporary, involuntary changes in body movement, function, sensation, awareness or behavior. Epilepsy Epilepsy is a chronic seizure condition . Almost 3 million Americans have some form of epilepsy. The seizures that occur with epilepsy usually can be controlled with medication. Still, some people with epilepsy who take seizure medication occasionally have seizures. Others who go a long time without a seizure may think that the condition has gone away and stop taking their medication, thus putting themselves at risk for another seizure. FIGURE 5-1 To care for a person who has fainted, place the person on his or her back lying \ufb02 at and loosen any restrictive clothing, such as a tie or collar. ",
                "71": "Sudden Illness 71 Febrile Seizures Young children and infants may be at risk for febrile seizures , which are seizures brought on by a rapid increase in body temperature. They are most common in children younger than 5 years. Febrile seizures often are caused by infections of the ear, throat or digestive system and are most likely to occur when a child or an infant experiences a rapid rise in temperature. A child or an infant experiencing a febrile seizure may experience some or all of the signals listed below. What to Look For Signals of seizures include: \u25a0 A blank stare. \u25a0 A period of distorted sensation during which the person is unable to respond. \u25a0 Uncontrolled muscular contractions, called convulsions , which last several minutes. A person with epilepsy may experience something called an aura before the seizure occurs. An aura is an unusual sensation or feeling, such as a visual hallucination; strange sound, taste or smell; or an urgent need to get to safety. If the person recognizes the aura, he or she may have time to tell bystanders and sit down before the seizure occurs. Febrile seizures may have some or all of the following signals: \u25a0 Sudden rise in body temperature \u25a0 Change in consciousness \u25a0 Rhythmic jerking of the head and limbs \u25a0 Loss of bladder or bowel control \u25a0 Confusion \u25a0 Drowsiness \u25a0 Crying out \u25a0 Becoming rigid \u25a0 Holding breath \u25a0 Upward rolling of the eyes Although it may be frightening to see someone unexpectedly having a seizure, you should remember that most seizures last only for a few minutes and the person usually recovers without problems. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if: \u25a0 The seizure lasts more than 5 minutes. \u25a0 The person has multiple seizures with no signs of slowing down. \u25a0 The person appears to be injured or fails to regain consciousness after the seizure. \u25a0 The cause of the seizure is unknown. \u25a0 The person is pregnant. \u25a0 The person has diabetes. \u25a0 The person is a young child or an infant and experienced a febrile seizure brought on by a high fever. \u25a0 The seizure takes place in water. \u25a0 The person is elderly and could have suffered a stroke. \u25a0 This is the person\u2019s \ufb01 rst seizure. If the person is known to have occasional seizures, you may not have to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. He or she usually will recover from a seizure in a few minutes. What to Do Until Help Arrives Although it may be frightening to watch, you can easily help to care for a person having a seizure. Remember that he or she cannot control the seizure. Do not try to stop the seizure. General principles of managing a seizure are to prevent injury, protect the person\u2019s airway and make sure that the airway is open after the seizure has ended. Do not hold or restrain the person. Do not put anything in the person\u2019s mouth or between the teeth. People having seizures rarely bite their tongues or cheeks with enough force to cause signi\ufb01 cant bleeding; however, some blood may be present. Make sure that the environment is as safe as possible to prevent injury to the person who is having a seizure. Remove any nearby furniture or other objects that may injure the person. Give care to a person who has had a seizure the same way you would for an unconscious person. When the seizure is over, make sure that the person\u2019s airway is open. Usually, the person will begin to breathe normally. If there is \ufb02 uid in the person\u2019s mouth, such as saliva, blood or vomit, roll him or her on one side so that the \ufb02 uid drains from the mouth. If the child or infant has a febrile seizure, it is important to immediately cool the body by giving a sponge bath with lukewarm water. The person may be drowsy and disoriented or unresponsive for a period of time. Check to see if he or she was injured during the seizure. Be comforting and reassuring. If the seizure occurred in public, the person may be embarrassed and self-conscious. Ask bystanders not to crowd around the person. He or she may be tired and want to rest. Stay on the scene with the person until he or she is fully conscious and aware of the surroundings. For more information on epilepsy, visit the Epilepsy Foundation at epilepsyfoundation.org. ",
                "72": "Stroke Stroke is the third-leading killer and a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States. Nearly 800,000 Americans will have a stroke this year. A stroke, also called a brain attack , is caused when blood \ufb02 ow to a part of the brain is cut off or when there is bleeding into the brain. Strokes can cause permanent brain damage, but sometimes the damage can be stopped or reversed. A stroke usually is caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply blood to the brain. Once the blood \ufb02 ow is cut off, that part of the brain starts to \u201csuffocate\u201d and die unless the blood \ufb02 ow can be restored. Blockages can be caused by blood clots that travel from other parts of the body, like the heart, or they can be caused by slow damage to the arteries over time from diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes. In a small percentage of strokes there is bleeding into the brain. This bleeding can be from a broken blood vessel or from a bulging aneurysm that has broken open. There is no way to tell the type of stroke until the person gets to an emergency room and undergoes a thorough medical evaluation. A mini-stroke is when a person has the signals of a stroke, which then completely go away. Most mini-strokes get better within a few minutes, although they can last several hours. Although the signals of a mini-stroke disappear quickly, the person is not out of danger at that point. In fact, someone who has a mini-stroke is at very high risk of having a full stroke within the next 2 days. Risk Factors The risk factors for stroke, meaning things that make a stroke more likely, are similar to those for heart disease. Some risk factors are beyond one\u2019s control, such as age, gender and family history of stroke or cardiovascular disease. Other risk factors can be controlled through diet, changes in lifestyle or medication. With a history of high blood pressure, previous stroke or mini-stroke, diabetes or heart disease one\u2019s chances of a stroke increases. High Blood Pressure Uncontrolled high blood pressure is the number one risk factor for stroke. If you have high blood pressure, you are approximately seven times more likely to have a stroke compared with someone who does not have high blood pressure. High blood pressure puts added pressure on arteries and makes them stiffer. The excess pressure also damages organs, including the brain, heart and kidneys. Even mildly elevated blood pressure can increase one\u2019s risk of a stroke. High blood pressure is the most important of the controllable risk factors. Have your blood pressure checked regularly and if it is high, follow the advice of your health care provider about how to lower it. Often, high blood pressure can be controlled by losing weight, changing diet, exercising routinely and managing stress. If those measures are not suf\ufb01 cient, your health care provider may prescribe medication. Diabetes Diabetes is a major risk factor for stroke. If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, follow the advice of your health care provider about how to control it. If uncontrolled, the resulting elevated blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels throughout the body. Cigarette Smoking Cigarette smoking is another major risk factor of stroke. Smoking is linked to heart disease and cancer, as well as to stroke. Smoking increases blood pressure, damages blood vessels and makes blood more likely to clot. If you smoke and would like to quit, many techniques and support systems are available to help, including seeking help from your health care provider and local health department. The bene\ufb01 ts of quitting smoking begin as soon as you stop, and some of the damage from smoking actually may be reversible. Approximately 10 years after a person has stopped smoking, his or her risk of stroke is about the same as the risk for a person who has never smoked. Even if you do not smoke, be aware that inhaling smoke from smokers can harm your health. Avoid long-term exposure to cigarette smoke and protect children from this danger as well. Diet Diets that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol can increase your risk of stroke by causing fatty materials to build up on the walls of your blood vessels. Foods high in cholesterol include egg yolks and organ meats, such as liver and kidneys. Saturated fats are found in beef, lamb, veal, pork, ham, whole milk and whole-milk products. Limiting your intake of these foods can help to prevent stroke. Preventing Stroke You can help prevent stroke if you: \u25a0 Control your blood pressure. \u25a0 Quit smoking. \u25a0 Eat a healthy diet. \u25a0 Exercise regularly. Regular exercise reduces your chances of stroke by strengthening the heart and improv ing blood circulation. Exercise also helps in weight control. ",
                "73": "Sudden Illness 73 \u25a0 Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight increases the chance of developing high blood pressure, heart disease and fat deposits lining the arteries. \u25a0 Control diabetes. What to Look For As with other sudden illnesses, looking or feeling ill, or behaving in a strange way, are common, general signals of a stroke or mini-stroke. Other speci\ufb01 c signals of stroke have a sudden onset , including: \u25a0 Weakness or numbness of the face, arm or leg. This usually happens on only one side of the body. \u25a0 Facial droop or drooling. \u25a0 Trouble with speech. The person may have trouble talking, getting words out or being understood when speaking and may have trouble understanding. \u25a0 Loss of vision or disturbed (blurred or dimmed) vision in one or both eyes. The pupils may be of unequal size. \u25a0 Sudden severe headache. The person will not know what caused the headache and may describe it as \u201cthe worst headache ever.\u201d \u25a0 Dizziness, confusion, agitation, loss of consciousness or other severe altered mental status. \u25a0 Loss of balance or coordination, trouble walking or ringing in the ears. \u25a0 Incontinence. Think FAST for a Stroke For a stroke, think FAST, which stands for the following: \u25a0 Face : Weakness, numbness or drooping on one side of the face. Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop (Fig. 5-2, A)? \u25a0 Arm: Weakness or numbness in one arm. Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward (Fig. 5-2, B)? \u25a0 Speech : Slurred speech or dif\ufb01 culty speaking. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence (e.g., Ask the person to say something like, \u201cThe sky is blue.\u201d) Are the words slurred? Can the person repeat the sentence correctly? \u25a0 Time: Try to determine when the signals began. If the person shows any signals of stroke, time is critical. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number right away. The FAST mnemonic is based on the Cincinnati Pre-Hospital Stroke Scale. This scale originally was developed for EMS personnel in 1997. The scale was designed to help EMS personnel to identify strokes in the \ufb01 eld. The FAST method for public awareness has been in use in the community in Cincinnati, Ohio, since 1999. Researchers at the University of North Carolina validated it in 2003 as an appropriate tool for helping lay persons to recognize and respond quickly to the signals of stroke. By paying attention to the signals of stroke and reporting them to your health care provider, you can prevent damage before it occurs. Experiencing a mini-stroke is the clearest warning that a stroke may occur. Do not ignore its stroke-like signals, even if they disappear completely within minutes or hours. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately if you encounter someone who is having or has had a stroke, if you see signals of a stroke or if the person had a mini-stroke (even if the signals have gone away). Note the time of onset of signals and report it to the call taker or EMS personnel when they arrive. In the past, a stroke usually caused permanent brain damage.

                "74": "procedures can limit or reduce the damage caused by stroke. Many of these new treatments must be given quickly to be the most helpful. It is important for the person to get the best care as quickly as possible. What to Do Until Help Arrives Note the time that the signals started. If the person is unconscious, make sure that he or she has an open airway and care for life-threatening conditions. If \ufb02 uid or vomit is in the person\u2019s mouth, position him or her on one side to allow \ufb02 uids to drain out of the mouth. Remove any material from the mouth with a \ufb01 nger if the person is unconscious. Stay with the person and monitor breathing and for any changes in the person\u2019s condition. If the person is conscious, check for non-life-threatening conditions. A stroke can make the person fearful and anxious. Often, he or she does not understand what has happened. Offer comfort and reassurance. Have the person rest in a comfortable position. Do not give him or her anything to eat or drink. Diabetic Emergencies A total of 23.6 million people in the United States (7.8% of the population) have diabetes. Among this group, more than 5 million people are unaware that they have the disease. Diabetes was the seventh- leading cause of death listed on U.S. death certi\ufb01 cates in 2006. Altogether, diabetes contributed to 233,619 deaths in 2005. Diabetes is likely to be underreported as a cause of death. Overall, the risk for death among people with diabetes is about twice that of people without diabetes. The American Diabetes Association de\ufb01 nes diabetes as the inability of the body to change sugar (glucose) from food into energy. This process is regulated by insulin , a hormone produced in the pancreas. Diabetes can lead to other medical conditions such as blindness, nerve disease, kidney disease, heart disease and stroke. The cells in your body need glucose (sugar) as a source of energy. The cells receive this energy during digestion or from stored forms of sugar. The sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream with the help of insulin . Insulin is produced in the pancreas. For the body to properly function, there has to be a balance of insulin and sugar. People who have diabetes may become suddenly ill because there is too much or too little sugar in their blood. There are two major types of diabetes: Type I and Type II diabetes. Type I diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, affects about 1 million Americans. This type of diabetes, which usually begins in childhood, occurs when the body produces little or no insulin. People with Type I diabetes must inject insulin into their bodies daily and are therefore considered to be insulin-dependent. Type I diabetes is a chronic disease that currently has no cure. The exact cause of Type I diabetes is not known. Warning signals include: \u25a0 Frequent urination. \u25a0 Increased hunger and thirst. \u25a0 Unexpected weight loss. \u25a0 Irritability. \u25a0 Weakness and fatigue. Type II diabetes is the most common type, affecting about 90 to 95 percent of people with diabetes. This condition usually occurs in adults but also can occur in children. With Type II diabetes, the body makes insulin but not enough to meet the body\u2019s needs or the body becomes resistant to the insulin produced. Since Type II diabetes is a progressive disease, people with this type of diabetes eventually may need to use insulin. People from certain racial and ethnic backgrounds are known to be at greater risk for diabetes. Type II diabetes is more common among African-Americans, Latinos, Asians, certain Native Americans and Paci\ufb01 c Islanders. Although genetics and other factors increase risk for diabetes, being overweight or obese also is a risk factor for developing the disease in adults and children. People with Type II diabetes often do not experience any warning signals. Possible warning signals of Type II diabetes include: \u25a0 Any signals of Type I diabetes. \u25a0 Frequent infections, especially involving the skin, gums and bladder. \u25a0 Blurred vision. \u25a0 Numbness in the legs, feet and \ufb01 ngers. \u25a0 Cuts or bruises that are slow to heal. \u25a0 Itching. People with diabetes should monitor their exercise and diet. Self-monitoring for blood sugar levels is a valuable tool. Insulin-dependent diabetics also must monitor their use of insulin. If the person with diabetes does not control these factors, he or she can have a diabetic emergency. ",
                "75": "Sudden Illness 75 A diabetic emergency is caused by an imbalance between sugar and insulin in the body (Fig. 5-3). A diabetic emergency can happen when there is: \u25a0 Too much sugar in the blood ( hyperglycemia ): Among other causes, the person may not have taken enough insulin or the person is reacting adversely to a large meal or a meal that is high in carbohydrates. \u25a0 Too little sugar in the blood ( hypoglycemia ): The person may have taken too much insulin, eaten too little food, or overexerted him- or herself. Extremely low blood sugar levels can quickly become life threatening. What to Look For Signals of a diabetic emergency include: \u25a0 Changes in the level of consciousness. \u25a0 Changes in mood. \u25a0 Rapid breathing and pulse. \u25a0 Feeling and looking ill. \u25a0 Dizziness and headache. \u25a0 Confusion. When to Call 9-1-1 Always call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if: \u25a0 The person is unconscious or about to lose consciousness. In this situation, do not give the person anything by mouth. After calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, care for the person in the same way you would care for an unconscious person. This includes making sure the person\u2019s airway is clear of vomit, checking for breathing and giving care until advanced medical personnel take over. \u25a0 The person is conscious but unable to swallow. (In this case, do not put anything, liquid or solid, into the person\u2019s mouth.) \u25a0 The person does not feel better within about 5 minutes after taking some form of sugar. \u25a0 You cannot \ufb01 nd any form of sugar immediately. Do not spend time looking for it. What to Do Until Help Arrives You may know the person is a diabetic or the person may tell you he or she is a diabetic. Often diabetics know what is wrong and will ask for something with sugar in it. They may carry some form of sugar with them in case they need it. If the diabetic person is conscious and able to swallow, and advises you that he or she needs sugar, give sugar in the form of several glucose tablets or glucose paste, a 12-ounce serving of fruit juice, milk, nondiet soft drink or table sugar dissolved in a glass of water (Fig. 5-4). Most fruit juices and nondiet soft drinks have enough sugar to be effective. If the problem is too much sugar, this amount of sugar will not cause further harm. Diabetics also may carry glucagon, which they can self-administer to counter hypoglycemia. People who take insulin to control diabetes may have injectable medication with them to care for hyperglycemia. FIGURE 5-3 Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are diabetic emergencies that result from an imbalance between sugar and insulin within the body.

                "76": "For more information about diabetes, contact the American Diabetes Association at 1-800-DIABETES, go to diabetes.org or visit the National Diabetes Education Program website at ndep.nih.gov. For speci\ufb01 c information about Type I diabetes, contact the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation at 1-800-533-CURE or at jdrf.org. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions are caused by over activity of the immune system against speci\ufb01 c antigens (foreign substances). People with allergies are especially sensitive to these antigens. When their immune systems overreact to the antigens it is called an allergic reaction . Antigens that often cause allergic reactions in at-risk people include the following: \u25a0 Bee or insect venom \u25a0 Antibiotics \u25a0 Pollen \u25a0 Animal dander \u25a0 Latex \u25a0 Sulfa drugs \u25a0 Certain foods (e.g., tree nuts, peanuts, shell\ufb01 sh and dairy products) People who know that they are severely allergic to certain substances or bee stings may wear a medical ID tag, necklace or bracelet. What to Look For Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. An example of a mild reaction is an itchy skin rash from touching poison ivy. Severe allergic reactions can cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis (also called anaphylactic shock ). Anaphylaxis usually occurs suddenly. It happens within seconds or minutes after contact with the substance. The skin or area of the body that comes in contact with the substance usually swells and turns red. Other signals include the following: \u25a0 Hives \u25a0 Itching \u25a0 Rash \u25a0 Weakness \u25a0 Nausea \u25a0 Stomach cramps \u25a0 Vomiting \u25a0 Dizziness \u25a0 Trouble breathing (including coughing and wheezing) Trouble breathing can progress to a blocked airway as the lips, tongue, throat and larynx (voice box) swell. Low blood pressure and shock may accompany these reactions. Death from anaphylaxis may happen quickly because the person\u2019s breathing is restricted severely. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the person: \u25a0 Has trouble breathing. \u25a0 Complains of the throat tightening. \u25a0 Explains that he or she is subject to severe allergic reactions. \u25a0 Is unconscious. What to Do Until Help Arrives If you suspect anaphylaxis and have called 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, follow these guidelines for giving care: 1. Monitor the person\u2019s breathing and for any changes in the person\u2019s condition. 2. Give care for life-threatening emergencies. 3. Check a conscious person to determine: { The substance (antigen) involved. { The route of exposure to the antigen. { The effects of the exposure. 4.  Assist the person with using an epinephrine auto- injector, if available and state or local regulations allow. 5.  Assist the person with taking an antihistamine, if available. 6.  Document any changes in the person\u2019s condition over time. For more information on anaphylaxis, see Chapter 11. POISONING A poison is any substance that causes injury, illness or death if it enters the body. In 2008, Poison Control Centers (PCCs) received more than 2.4 million calls having to do with people who had come into contact with a poison. Over 93 percent of these poisonings took place in the home. Fifty percent (1.2 million) involved children younger than 6 years. Poisoning deaths in children younger than 6 years represented about 2 percent of the total deaths from poisoning. The 20- to 59-year-old age group represented about 76 percent of all deaths from poisoning. In recent years there has been a decrease in child poisonings. This is due partly to child-resistant packaging for medications. This packaging makes it harder for children to get into these substances. The decrease also is a result of preventive actions by parents and others who care for children. At the same time, there has been an increase in adult poisoning deaths. This increase is linked to an increase in both suicides and drug-related poisonings. ",
                "77": "Sudden Illness 77 Types of Poisoning A person can be poisoned by swallowing poison, breathing it, absorbing it through the skin and by having it injected into the body. Swallowed Poisons Poisons that can be swallowed include foods, such as certain mushrooms and shell\ufb01 sh; an overdose of drugs, such as sleeping pills, tranquilizers and alcohol; medications, such as a high quantity of aspirin; household items, such as cleaning products and pesticides; and certain plants. Many substances that are not poisonous in small amounts are poisonous in larger amounts. Combining certain substances can result in poisoning, although if taken by themselves they might not cause harm. Inhaled Poisons A person can be poisoned by breathing in (inhaling) toxic fumes. Examples of poisons that can be inhaled include: \u25a0 Gases, such as: { Carbon monoxide from an engine or car exhaust. { Carbon dioxide from wells and sewers. { Chlorine, found in many swimming pools. \u25a0 Fumes from: { Household products, such as glues and paints. \u25a0 Drugs, such as crack cocaine. Absorbed Poisons Poisons that can be absorbed through the skin come from many sources including plants, such as poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac, and fertilizers and pesticides. Injected Poisons Injected poisons enter the body through the bites or stings of insects, spiders, ticks, some marine life, snakes and other animals or through drugs or medications injected with a hypodermic needle. What to Look For How will you know if someone who is ill has been poisoned? Look for clues about what has happened. Try to get information from the person or from bystanders. As you check the scene, be aware of unusual odors, \ufb02 ames, smoke, open or spilled containers, an open medicine cabinet or an overturned or a damaged plant. Also, notice if the person is showing any of the following signals of poisoning: \u25a0 Nausea and vomiting \u25a0 Diarrhea \u25a0 Chest or abdominal pain \u25a0 Trouble breathing \u25a0 Sweating \u25a0 Changes in consciousness \u25a0 Seizures \u25a0 Headache \u25a0 Dizziness \u25a0 Weakness \u25a0 Irregular pupil size \u25a0 Burning or tearing eyes \u25a0 Abnormal skin color \u25a0 Burns around the lips, tongue or on the skin You also may suspect a poisoning based on information from or about the person. If you suspect someone has swallowed a poison, try to \ufb01 nd out: \u25a0 The type of poison. \u25a0 The quantity taken. \u25a0 When it was taken. \u25a0 How much the person weighs. This information can help you and others to give the most appropriate care. When to Call 9-1-1 For life-threatening conditions (such as if a person is unconscious or is not breathing or if a change in the level of consciousness occurs), CALL 9-1-1 or local emergency number. If the person is conscious and alert, CALL the National Poison Control Center (PCC) hotline at 1-800-222-1222 and follow the advice given. What to Do Until Help Arrives After you have checked the scene and determined that there has been a poisoning, follow these general care guidelines: \u25a0 Remove the person from the source of poison if the scene is dangerous. Do this only if you are able to without endangering yourself. \u25a0 Check the person\u2019s level of consciousness and breathing. \u25a0 Care for any life-threatening conditions. \u25a0 If the person is conscious, ask questions to get more information. \u25a0 Look for any containers and take them with you to the telephone. \u25a0 Call the National Poison Control Center Hotline at 1-800 222-1222. \u25a0 Follow the directions of the Poison Control Center. If the person becomes violent or threatening, move to safety and wait for help to arrive. Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless medical professionals tell you to do so. If you do not know what the poison was and the person vomits, save some of the vomit. The hospital may analyze it to identify the poison. ",
                "78": "FOCUS ON PREVENTION POISONING Use common sense when handling substances that could be harmful, such as chemicals and cleaners. Use them in a well-ventilated area. Wear protective clothing, such as gloves and a facemask. Use common sense with your own medications. Read the product information and use only as directed. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist about the intended effects, side effects and possible interactions with other medications that you are taking. Never use another person\u2019s prescribed medications. What is right for one person often is wrong for another. Always keep medications in their original containers. Make sure that this container is well marked with the original pharmacy labeling. If taking several medications, always check the label to ensure that you are taking the correct medication, and be especially aware of possible adverse drug interactions. Over time, expired medications can become less effective and even toxic to humans if consumed. Dispose of out-of-date or unused medications properly by following the guidelines below. Most medications should be thrown away in the household trash and not \ufb02 ushed down the toilet. Follow these steps to maintain safety and protect the environment from unnecessary exposure to medications: 1.  Pour the medication out of its original container into a sealable plastic bag. 2.  Mix the medication with something that will hide the medication or make it unpleasant (e.g., coffee grounds or kitty litter). 3. Seal the plastic bag. 4.  Throw the plastic bag into your household trash. 5.  Remove and destroy all personal information and medication information (prescription label) from the medication container. Recycle or throw away the medication container. Another option is to check if your state or local community has a community-based household hazardous waste collection program. You may be able to take your expired and unused medications to your pharmacy or another location for disposal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website maintains a list of some of the medications that should be \ufb02 ushed down the toilet. These medications are especially dangerous to humans and pets. One dose could cause death if taken by someone other than the person for whom it was prescribed. Flushing these medications avoids any chance that children or pets would ingest them accidentally. According to the FDA, any possible risk to people and the environment from \ufb02 ushing these few medications is small. The FDA maintains that the risk is outweighed by the possibility of someone accidentally ingesting these medications, which could be life threatening. Preventing Poisoning in Children Many substances found in or around the house are poisonous. Children younger than 3 years and infants that are able to crawl are especially likely to be poisoned because of their curious nature, and because they explore their world through touching and tasting things around them (Fig. 5-5). If you care for or are near young children, be warned: it only takes a moment for a small child to get into trouble. ( Continued ) FIGURE 5-5 Always supervise young children closely, especially in areas where common, but poisonous, household items are stored. ",
                "79": "Sudden Illness 79 FOCUS ON PREPAREDNESS POISON CONTROL CENTERS There are 60 regional PCCs across the United States. These centers are dedicated to helping people deal with poisons. Medical professionals staff PCCs. These professionals give free, 24-hour advice to callers. PCC staff have access to information about most poisonous substances. They also can tell you what to do if a poisoning happened or is suspected. If you think a person has been poisoned and the person is conscious, call the National Poison Control Center hotline at 1-800-222-1222 \ufb01 rst. When you call this number,  your call is automatically routed to your regional PCC based on the area code from which you called. The regional PCC staff then will tell you what care to give. They also will tell you whether you should call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. In 2008, PCCs answered over 2.4 million calls about poisonings. In over 70 percent of the cases, the caller was able to get the help needed without having to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, or go to the hospital or health care provider. PCCs help reduce the workload of the EMS personnel and safely reduce the number of emergency room visits. Be prepared: Keep the telephone number of the National Poison Control Center hotline posted by every telephone in your home or of\ufb01 ce! FOCUS ON PREVENTION ( Continued ) Most child poisonings take place when a parent or guardian is watching a child. Follow these guidelines to guard against poisoning emergencies in children: \u25a0 Always supervise children closely, especially in areas where poisons are commonly stored, such as kitchens, bathrooms and garages. \u25a0 Keep children out of your work area when you are using potentially harmful substances. \u25a0 Consider all household or drugstore products to be potentially harmful. \u25a0 Read all labels of products you use in your home. Look for these words on bottles and packages: \u201cCaution,\u201d \u201cWarning,\u201d \u201cPoison,\u201d \u201cDanger\u201d or \u201cKeep Out of Reach of Children.\u201d \u25a0 Be careful when using and storing household products with fruit shown on the labels. Children may think that they are okay to drink. \u25a0 Remove all medications and medical supplies from bags, purses, pockets, shelves, unlocked cabinets and drawers. \u25a0 Keep all medications, medical supplies and household products locked away, well out of the reach of children and away from food and drinks. \u25a0 Install special child safety locks to keep children from opening cabinets. \u25a0 Use childproof safety caps on all medications, chemicals and cleaning products. \u25a0 Never call medicine \u201ccandy\u201d to get a child to take it, even if it has a pleasant candy \ufb02 avor. \u25a0 Keep products in their original containers with the original labels in place. \u25a0 Use poison symbols to identify dangerous substances and teach children the meaning of the symbols. \u25a0 Dispose of outdated or unused medications and household products as recommended (see above for appropriate disposal of medications). ",
                "80": "Special Care Considerations Toxic Fumes It is often dif\ufb01 cult to tell if a poisoning victim has inhaled toxic fumes. Toxic fumes come from a variety of sources. They may have an odor or be odor-free. When someone breathes in toxic fumes, the person\u2019s skin may turn pale or ashen, which indicates a lack of oxygen. If it is safe for you to do so, get the person to fresh air. Anyone who has inhaled toxic fumes needs fresh air as soon as possible. Chemicals In the case of poisoning with dry chemicals, such as lime, brush off the dry chemicals with gloved hands or a cloth. Carefully remove any contaminated clothing but avoid contaminating yourself or others. Then \ufb02 ush the area thoroughly with large amounts of water. Be careful not to get any of the chemicals in your eyes or the eyes of the person or of bystanders. If the poisoning resulted from wet chemicals coming into contact with the skin, \ufb02 ush the affected area with large amounts of cool water (Fig. 5-6). Have someone else call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. Keep \ufb02 ushing the area until EMS personnel arrive. Substance Abuse People in our society abuse numerous drugs and other substances. This substance abuse causes a wide range of psychological and physical effects. What to Look For Signals of possible substance abuse include: \u25a0 Behavioral changes not otherwise explained. \u25a0 Sudden mood changes. \u25a0 Restlessness, talkativeness or irritability. \u25a0 Changes in consciousness, including loss of consciousness. \u25a0 Slurred speech or poor coordination. \u25a0 Moist or \ufb02 ushed skin. \u25a0 Chills, nausea or vomiting. \u25a0 Dizziness or confusion. \u25a0 Irregular pulse. \u25a0 Abnormal breathing. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the person: \u25a0 Is unconscious, confused or seems to be losing consciousness. \u25a0 Has trouble breathing or is breathing irregularly. \u25a0 Has persistent chest pain or pressure. \u25a0 Has pain or pressure in the abdomen that does not go away. \u25a0 Is vomiting blood or passing blood. \u25a0 Has a seizure, severe headache or slurred speech. \u25a0 Acts violently. Also call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if you are unsure what to do or you are unsure about the seriousness of the problem. What to Do Until Help Arrives If you think that a person took an overdose or has another substance abuse problem requiring medical attention or other professional help, you should check the scene for safety and check the person. If you have good reason to suspect that a substance was taken, call the National Poison Control Center Hotline at 1-800-222-1222 and follow the call taker\u2019s directions. In general, to care for the person, you should: \u25a0 Try to learn from others what substances may have been taken. \u25a0 Calm and reassure the person. \u25a0 Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated to minimize shock. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER When a person becomes ill suddenly, it can be frightening to that person, to you and to other bystanders. It may be dif\ufb01 cult to determine what is causing the sudden illness, and you might not know what care to give. However, if you have learned the general signals as well as the signals of speci\ufb01 c sudden illnesses, you can give care con\ufb01 dently and quickly.

                "82": "HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES AND COLD-RELATED EMERGENCIES Exposure to extreme heat or cold can make a person seriously ill. The likelihood of illness also depends on factors such as physical activity, clothing, wind, humidity, working and living conditions, and a person\u2019s age and state of mind (Fig. 6-1). Once the signals of a heat-related illness or cold-related emergency begin to appear, a person\u2019s condition can quickly worsen. A heat-related illness or cold-related emergency can result in death. If you see any of the signals, act quickly. People at risk for heat-related illness or a cold-related emergency include those who work or exercise outdoors, elderly people, young children and people with health problems. Also at risk are those who have had a heat-related illness or cold-related emergency in the past, those with medical conditions that cause poor blood circulation and those who take medications to eliminate water from the body ( diuretics ). People usually try to get out of extreme heat or cold before they begin to feel ill. However, some people do not or cannot. Athletes and those who work outdoors often keep working even after they begin to feel ill. People living in buildings with poor ventilation, poor insulation or poor heating or cooling systems are at increased risk of heat-related illnesses or cold-related emergencies. Often they might not even recognize that they are in danger of becoming ill. Heat-Related Illness Heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are conditions caused by overexposure to heat, loss of \ufb02 uids and electrolytes. Heat Cramps Heat cramps are the least severe of the heat-related illnesses. They often are the \ufb01 rst signals that the body is having trouble with the heat. What to Look For Heat cramps are painful muscle spasms. They usually occur in the legs and abdomen. Think of them as a warning of a possible heat-related illness. What to Do To care for heat cramps, help the person move to a cool place to rest. Give an electrolyte- and carbohydrate-containing \ufb02 uid such as a commercial sports drink, fruit juice or milk. Water also may be given. Lightly stretch the muscle and gently massage the area (Fig. 6-2). The person should not take salt tablets. They can worsen the situation. When cramps stop, the person usually can start activity again if there are no other signals of illness. He or she should keep drinking plenty of \ufb02 uids. Watch the person carefully for further signals of heat-related illness. FIGURE 6-1 Exposure to extreme heat or cold can make a person seriously ill. FIGURE 6-2 Lightly stretching the muscle and gently massaging the area, along with having the person rest and giving electrolyte- and carbohydrate-containing \ufb02 uids, usually is enough for the body to recover from heat cramps. 9\u02da -9\u02da 32\u02da ",
                "83": "Environmental Emergencies 83 Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion is a more severe condition than heat cramps. It often affects athletes, \ufb01 re\ufb01 ghters, construction workers and factory workers. It also affects those who wear heavy clothing in a hot, humid environment. What to Look For Signals of heat exhaustion include cool, moist, pale, ashen or \ufb02 ushed skin; headache; nausea; dizziness; weakness; and exhaustion. What to Do When a heat-related illness is recognized in its early stages, it usually can be reversed. Get the person out of the heat. Move the person to a cooler environment with circulating air. Loosen or remove as much clothing as possible and apply cool, wet cloths, such as towels or sheets, taking care to remoisten the cloths periodically (Fig. 6-3). Spraying the person with water and fanning also can help. If the person is conscious and able to swallow, give him or her small amounts of a cool \ufb02 uid such as a commercial sports drink or fruit juice to restore \ufb02 uids and electrolytes. Milk or water also may be given. Do not let the conscious person drink too quickly. Give about 4 ounces of \ufb02 uid every 15 minutes. Let the person rest in a comfortable position and watch carefully for changes in his or her condition. The person should not resume normal activities the same day. If the person\u2019s condition does not improve or he or she refuses \ufb02 uids, has a change in consciousness or vomits, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, as these are indications that the person\u2019s condition is getting worse. Stop giving \ufb02 uids and place the person on his or her side to keep the airway open. Watch for signals of breathing problems. Keep the person lying down and continue to cool the body any way you can (see What to Do Until Help Arrives). Heat Stroke Heat stroke is the least common but most severe heat-related illness. It usually occurs when people ignore the signals of heat exhaustion. Heat stroke develops when the body systems are overwhelmed by heat and begin to stop functioning. Heat stroke is a serious medical emergency. What to Look For Signals of heat stroke include extremely high body temperature, red skin that can be either dry or moist; changes in consciousness; rapid, weak pulse; rapid, shallow breathing; confusion; vomiting; and seizures. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. Heat stroke is a life-threatening emergency. What to Do Until Help Arrives \u25a0 Preferred method: Rapidly cool the body by immersing the person up to the neck in cold water, if possible. OR Douse or spray the person with cold water. \u25a0 Sponge the person with ice water-doused towels over the entire body, frequently rotating the cold, wet towels. \u25a0 Cover with bags of ice. \u25a0 If you are not able to measure and monitor the person\u2019s temperature, apply rapid cooling methods for 20 minutes or until the person\u2019s condition improves. \u25a0 Give care according for other conditions found. Cold-Related Emergencies Frostbite and hypothermia are two types of cold- related emergencies. Frostbite Frostbite is the freezing of body parts exposed to the cold. Severity depends on the air temperature, length of exposure and the wind. Frostbite can result in the loss of \ufb01 ngers, hands, arms, toes, feet and legs. What to Look For The signals of frostbite include lack of feeling in the affected area, swelling and skin that appears waxy, is cold to the touch or is discolored (\ufb02 ushed, white, yellow or blue). In more serious cases, blisters may form and the affected part may turn black and show signs of deep tissue damage. FIGURE 6-3 When you recognize a heat-related illness, get the person out of the heat, loosen or remove clothing and apply cool, wet cloths, such as towels or sheets. Spraying the person with water and fanning also can be effective. ",

What to Do Until Help Arrives To care for frostbite, handle the area gently. Remove wet clothing and jewelry, if possible, from the affected area. Never rub a frostbitten area. Rubbing causes further damage to soft tissues. Do not attempt to rewarm the frostbitten area if there is a chance that it might refreeze or if you are close to a medical facility. For minor frostbite, rapidly rewarm the affected part using skin-to-skin contact such as with a warm hand. To care for a more serious injury, gently soak it in water not warmer than about 105\u00b0 F (Fig. 6-4, A). If you do not have a thermometer, test the water temperature yourself. If the temperature is uncomfortable to your touch, it is too warm. Keep the frostbitten part in the water until normal color returns and it feels warm (20 to 30 minutes). Loosely bandage the area with a dry, sterile dressing (Fig. 6-4, B). If \ufb01 ngers or toes are frostbitten, place cotton or gauze between them. Do not break any blisters. Take precautions to prevent hypothermia. Monitor the person\u2019s condition, and if you see that the person is going into shock, give care accordingly. Do not give ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02 ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when caring for frostbite. Hypothermia In a hypothermic condition, the entire body cools because its ability to keep warm is failing. The person will die if not given the proper care. The air temperature does not have to be below freezing for people to develop hypothermia. This is especially true if the person is wet or if it is windy. Elderly people in poorly heated homes can develop hypothermia. The homeless, the ill and young children also are at risk. Certain conditions can more easily lead to hypothermia, including: \u25a0 Ingestion of substances that interfere with the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature (such as alcohol, other drugs and certain medications). \u25a0 Any medical condition that impairs circulation, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. \u25a0 Prolonged exposure to cold, wet and/or windy conditions or wet clothing. What to Look For Signals of hypothermia include the following: \u25a0 Shivering \u25a0 Numbness \u25a0 Glassy stare \u25a0 Indifference \u25a0 Loss of consciousness Shivering that stops without rewarming is a sign that the person\u2019s condition is worsening. He or she needs immediate medical care. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately for any case of hypothermia. FIGURE 6-4, A\u2013B To care for more serious frostbite: A, Warm the area gently by soaking the affected part in water not warmer than 105\u02da F.

Gently move the person to a warm place. Remove wet clothing and dry the person. Put on dry clothing. Warm the body gradually by wrapping the person in blankets and plastic sheeting to hold in body heat (Fig. 6-5). Also, keep the head covered to further retain body heat. If you are far from medical care, position the person near a heat source or apply heat pads or other heat sources to the body, such as containers \ufb01 lled with warm water. Carefully monitor any heat source to avoid burning the person. Keep a barrier, such as a blanket, towel or clothing, between the heat source and the person. If the person is alert, give warm liquids that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Alcohol can cause heat loss and caffeine can cause dehydration. Do not warm the person too quickly, such as by immersing the person in warm water. Check breathing and monitor for any changes in the person\u2019s condition and care for shock. In cases of severe hypothermia , the person may be unconscious. Breathing may have slowed or stopped. The body may feel stiff because the muscles became rigid. Check for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If the person is not breathing, perform CPR. Continue to warm the person until emergency medical services (EMS) personnel take over. Be prepared to use an automated external de\ufb01 brillator (AED), if available. Preventing Heat-Related Illnesses and Cold-Related Emergencies In general, you can prevent illnesses caused by overexposure to extreme temperatures. To prevent heat-related illnesses and cold-related emergencies, follow these guidelines: \u25a0 Do not go outdoors during the hottest or coldest part of the day. \u25a0 Change your activity level according to the temperature. \u25a0 Take frequent breaks. \u25a0 Dress appropriately for the environment. \u25a0 Drink large amounts of \ufb02 uids. BITES AND STINGS People are bitten and stung every day by insects, spiders, snakes, animals and marine life. Most of the time, these bites and stings do not cause serious problems. However, in rare circumstances, certain bites and stings can cause serious illness or even death in people who are sensitive to the venom. Insect Stings Most of the time, insect stings are harmless. If the person is allergic, an insect sting can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition. What to Look For Signals of an insect sting include: \u25a0 Presence of a stinger. \u25a0 Pain. \u25a0 Swelling. \u25a0 Signals of an allergic reaction. What to Do If someone is stung by an insect: \u25a0 Remove any visible stinger. Scrape it away from the skin with a clean \ufb01 ngernail or a plastic card, such as a credit card, or use tweezers (Fig. 6-6). In the case of a bee sting, if you use tweezers, grasp the stinger, not the venom sac. \u25a0 Wash the site with soap and water. \u25a0 Cover the site and keep it clean. \u25a0 Apply a cold pack to the area to reduce pain and swelling. \u25a0 Call 9-1-1 if the person has any trouble breathing or for any other signals of anaphylaxis. Tick-Borne Diseases Humans can get very sick from the bite of an infected tick. Some of the diseases spread by ticks include Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Babesia infection, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever occurs mostly in the spring and summer, and most cases occur in children. What to Look For Signals of Rocky Mountain spotted fever usually appear between 2 and 14 days after a tick bite. Initial signals of Rocky Mountain spotted fever include the following: \u25a0 Fever \u25a0 Nausea FIGURE 6-6 If someone is stung by an insect, scrape the stinger away from the skin with a clean \ufb01 ngernail or a plastic card, such as a credit card. FOCUS ON PREVENTION LAYER YOUR WAY TO WARMTH As long as seasonal changes and cold climates exist, preventing cold-related emergencies, such as hypothermia, remains important when we work or play outside. The best way to ensure your comfort and warmth outdoors is to layer your clothing. The \ufb01 rst layer, called the base layer, is next to your skin. The base layer helps to regulate your body temperature by moving perspiration away from your skin. This is important because if perspiration gets trapped inside your clothes, you can become chilled rapidly, which can lead to hypothermia. Thermal underwear makes a good base layer for cold weather. The fabrics that are best at moving sweat away from the skin (also called wicking ) are silk, merino wool and certain synthetics. Cotton is not a good choice because it traps moisture rather than wicking it away. The job of the middle layer is insulation. This layer keeps you warm; it helps you retain heat by trapping air close to your body. Natural \ufb01 bers, such as wool and goose down, are excellent insulators. So is synthetic \ufb02 eece. Vests, jackets and tights are examples of clothing that can be worn for insulation. The shell or outer layer protects you from wind, rain or snow. For cold weather, the shell layer should be both waterproof and \u201cbreathable.\u201d This will keep wind and water from getting inside of the other two layers while allowing perspiration to evaporate. The shell also should be roomy enough to \ufb01 t easily over the other layers without restricting your movement. One of the other advantages of layering is that you can make quick adjustments if the weather changes or you change your activity level. You can take clothes off when you become too warm and put them back on if you get cold. In addition to layering your clothes, to stay warm in cold weather you also should wear: \u25a0 A hat. \u25a0 A scarf or knit mask that covers your face and mouth. \u25a0 Sleeves that are snug at the wrist. \u25a0 Mittens (they are warmer than gloves). \u25a0 Water-resistant boots.

It \ufb01 rst appears as small spots on the wrists and ankles. It then spreads to the rest of the body. However, about one-third of persons infected with the illness do not get a rash. \u25a0 Abdominal pain. \u25a0 Joint pain. \u25a0 Diarrhea. When to Seek Medical Care Call a health care provider if the person develops signals of Rocky Mountain spotted fever after a tick bite. The health care provider is likely to prescribe antibiotics. In most cases, the person will recover fully. If left untreated, complications of Rocky Mountain spotted fever can be life threatening. Babesia Infection Babesia also called Babesiosis is a protozoa infection spread by deer ticks and black-legged ticks. It is more common during warm months, and most cases happen in the northeast and upper Midwest regions of the United States. What to Look For Many people infected with Babesia have no apparent symptoms. Some people may have \ufb02 u-like symptoms, such as: \u25a0 Fever \u25a0 Sweats \u25a0 Chills \u25a0 Body aches and headaches \u25a0 No appetite \u25a0 Nausea \u25a0 Fatigue Others infected with Babesia develop a type of anemia that can cause jaundice and dark urine. In some people, the disease can be life threatening if untreated. The elderly and persons with no spleen, a weak immune system or a serious health condition are the most susceptible. When to Seek Medical Care If a person develops any of the signals described above, he or she should seek medical care. Most people with signals of the disease can be treated successfully with prescription medications. Ehrlichiosis Most cases of infection with the bacteria ehrlichia in humans are caused by bites by an infected Lone Star tick, and occur mainly in the southern, eastern and south-central United States. What to Look For Many people with ehrlichiosis do not become ill. Some develop only mild signals that are seen 5 to 10 days after an infected tick bit the person. Initial signals include the following: \u25a0 Fever \u25a0 Headache \u25a0 Fatigue \u25a0 Muscle aches Other signals that may develop include the following: \u25a0 Nausea \u25a0 Vomiting \u25a0 Diarrhea \u25a0 Cough \u25a0 Joint pains \u25a0 Confusion \u25a0 Rash (in some cases) When to Seek Medical Care If the person becomes ill with any of the above signals described, he or she should seek medical care. Ehrlichiosis is treated with antibiotics. Lyme Disease Lyme disease is spreading throughout the United States. Although it is most prevalent on the east coast and the upper Midwest, cases of Lyme disease have been reported in all 50 states. Lyme disease is spread by the deer tick and black-legged tick, which attaches itself to \ufb01 eld mice and deer. Deer ticks are tiny and dif\ufb01 cult to see (Fig. 6-7). They are much smaller than the common dog tick or wood tick. They can be as small as a poppy seed or the head of a pin. Adult deer ticks are only as large as a grape seed. Because of the tick\u2019s tiny size, its bite usually is painless. Many people who develop Lyme disease cannot recall having been bitten. The tick is found around branches and in wooded and grassy areas. Like all ticks, it attaches itself to any warm-blooded animal with which it comes into direct contact, including humans. Deer ticks are active any time the temperature is above about 45 \u00b0 F. However, most cases of infection happen between May and late August, when ticks are most active and ",
                "88": "people spend more time outdoors. Recent studies indicate that the tick must remain embedded in human skin for about 36 to 48 hours to transmit the disease. More information on Lyme disease may be available from your local or state health department, the American Lyme Disease Foundation (aldf.com), or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (cdc.gov/features/lymedisease/). What to Look For The \ufb01 rst signal of infection may appear a few days or a few weeks after a tick bite. In 80 to 90 percent of all cases of Lyme disease, a rash starts as a small red area at the site of the bite. It may spread up to 7 inches across (Fig. 6-8). In fair-skinned people, the center may be a lighter color with the outer edges red and raised. This sometimes gives the rash a bull\u2019s-eye appearance. In some individuals, the rash may appear to be solid red. In dark-skinned people, the area may look black and blue, like a bruise. The rash may or may not be warm to the touch and usually is not itchy or painful. If a rash does appear, it will do so in about 1 to 2 weeks and may last for about 3 to 5 weeks. Some people with Lyme disease never develop a rash. Other signals of Lyme disease include fever, headache, weakness, and joint and muscle pain. These signals are similar to signals of \ufb02 u and can develop slowly. They might not occur at the same time as the rash. Lyme disease can get worse if it is not treated. Signals can include severe fatigue; fever; a stiff, aching neck; tingling or numbness in the \ufb01 ngers and toes; and facial paralysis. In its advanced stages Lyme disease may cause painful arthritis; numbness in the arms, hands or legs; severe headaches; long- or short-term memory loss; confusion; dizziness; and problems in seeing or hearing. Some of these signals could indicate problems with the brain or nervous system. Lyme disease may also cause heart problems such as an irregular or rapid heartbeat. When to Seek Medical Care If rash or \ufb02 u-like signals develop, the person should seek medical care immediately. A health care provider usually will prescribe antibiotics to treat Lyme disease. Antibiotics work quickly and effectively if taken as soon as possible. Most people who get treated early make a full recovery. If you suspect Lyme disease, do not delay seeking treatment. Treatment time is longer and less effective when the person has been infected for a long period of time. Preventing Tick-borne Diseases Follow the guidelines presented in Focus on Prevention: How to Beat Those Little Critters in this chapter for general tips on how to prevent contact with, and bites from, ticks when you are in wooded or grassy areas. To prevent tick-borne illnesses, always check for ticks immediately after outdoor activities. Most experts believe that the longer the tick stays attached to the skin, the greater the chances are of infection. Therefore, check for ticks at least once daily after having been outdoors. Quickly remove any ticks that you \ufb01 nd before they become swollen with blood. Wash all clothing. Be sure to check pets because they can carry ticks into the house, where they can then attach themselves to people or other pets. Pets also can develop signals of tick-borne diseases. If you \ufb01 nd a tick embedded in a person\u2019s skin, it must be removed . With a gloved hand, grasp the tick with \ufb01 ne-tipped and pointed tweezer that has a smooth inside FIGURE 6-7 Deer ticks are tiny and dif\ufb01 cult to see. \u00a9 iStockphoto .com/Martin Pietak.

Pull slowly, steadily and \ufb01 rmly with no twisting (Fig. 6-9). \u25a0 Do not try to burn off the tick. \u25a0 Do not apply petroleum jelly or nail polish to the tick. Put the tick in a container or jar with rubbing alcohol to kill it. Clean the bite area with soap and water and an antiseptic. Apply an antibiotic ointment if it is available and the person has no known allergies or sensitivities to the medication. Encourage the person to seek medical advice because of the risk of contracting a tick-borne disease. If you cannot remove the tick, have the person seek advanced medical care. Mosquito-Borne Illness: West Nile Virus West Nile virus (WNV) is passed on to humans and other animals by mosquitoes that bite them after feeding on infected birds. Recently, WNV has been reported in some mild climate areas of North America and Europe. WNV cannot be passed from one person to another. Also, no evidence supports that humans can acquire the disease by handling live or dead birds infected with WNV. However, it is still a good idea to use disposable gloves when handling an infected bird. Contact your local health department for instructions on reporting and disposing of the bird\u2019s body. For most people, the risk of infection by WNV is very low. Less than 1 percent of people who are bitten by mosquitoes develop any signals of the disease. In addition, relatively few mosquitoes actually carry WNV. People who spend a lot of time outdoors are at a higher risk for catching the disease. Only about 1 in every 150 people who are infected with WNV will become seriously ill. Preventing West Nile Virus The easiest and best way to avoid WNV is to prevent mosquito bites. Speci\ufb01 cally, you can: \u25a0 Use insect repellents containing DEET (N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) when you are outdoors. Follow the directions on the package (see Focus on Prevention: Repelling Those Pests ). \u25a0 Consider staying indoors at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. If you have to be outdoors during these times, use insect repellent and wear long sleeves and pants. Light-colored clothing can help you to see mosquitoes that land on you. \u25a0 Make sure you have good screens on your windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. \u25a0 Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying sources of standing water outside of the home, such as from \ufb02 owerpots, buckets and barrels. Also, change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly, drill drainage holes in tire swings so that water drains out and keep children\u2019s wading pools empty and on their sides when they are not being used.

Source: CDC.gov and redcross.org What to Look For Most people infected with WNV have no signals. Approximately 20 percent develop mild signals, such as fever and aches, which pass on their own. The risk of severe disease is higher for people 50 years and older. People typically develop signals of WNV between 3 and 14 days after an infected mosquito bites them. Signals of WNV include the following: \u25a0 High fever \u25a0 Headache \u25a0 Neck stiffness \u25a0 Confusion \u25a0 Coma \u25a0 Tremors \u25a0 Convulsions \u25a0 Muscle weakness \u25a0 Vision loss \u25a0 Numbness \u25a0 Paralysis These signals may last several weeks. In some cases, WNV can cause fatal encephalitis, which is a swelling of the brain that leads to death. FIGURE 6-9 Remove a tick by pulling slowly, steadily and \ufb01 rmly with \ufb01 ne-tipped tweezers. ",
                "90": "When to Seek Care If you develop signals of severe WNV illness, such as unusually severe headaches or confusion, seek medical attention immediately. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are encouraged to talk to their doctors if they develop signals that could indicate WNV. There is no speci\ufb01 c treatment for WNV infection or a vaccine to prevent it. In more severe cases, people usually need to go to the hospital, where they will receive intravenous \ufb02 uids, assistance with breathing and nursing care. Spider Bites and Scorpion Stings Few spiders in the United States can cause serious illness or death. However, the bites of the black widow and brown recluse spiders can, in rare cases, kill a person (Fig. 6-10, A\u2013B). Another dangerous spider is the northwestern brown, or hobo, spider. Widow spiders can be black, red or brown. The black widow spider is black with a reddish hourglass shape on the underside of its body and is the most venomous of the widow spiders. The brown recluse spider (also known as the violin or \ufb01 ddleback spider) has a distinctive violin-shaped pattern on the back of its front body section. These spiders prefer dark, out-of-the-way places. Examples of places where these spiders live include wood, rock and brush piles; dark garages; and attics. People often are bitten on their arms and hands when reaching into these places. FOCUS ON PREVENTION You can prevent bites and stings from insects, spiders, ticks or snakes by following these guidelines when you are in wooded or grassy areas: \u25a0 Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. \u25a0 Tuck your pant legs into your socks or boots. \u25a0 Use a rubber band or tape to hold pants against socks so that nothing can get under clothing. \u25a0 Tuck your shirt into your pants. \u25a0 Wear light-colored clothing to make it easier to see tiny insects or ticks. \u25a0 When hiking in woods and \ufb01 elds, stay in the middle of trails. Avoid underbrush and tall grass. \u25a0 If you are outdoors for a long time, check yourself several times during the day. Especially check in hairy areas of the body like the back of the neck and the scalp line. \u25a0 Inspect yourself carefully for insects or ticks after being outdoors or have someone else do it. \u25a0 Avoid walking in areas where snakes are known to live. \u25a0 If you encounter a snake, look around for others. Turn around and walk away on the same path on which you came. \u25a0 Wear sturdy hiking boots. \u25a0 If you have pets that go outdoors, spray them with repellent made for that type of pet. Apply the repellent according to the label and check your pet for ticks often. \u25a0 If you will be in a grassy or wooded area for a long time or if you know that the area is highly infested with insects or ticks, consider using a repellent. Follow the directions carefully. HOW TO BEAT THOSE LITTLE CRITTERS FIGURE 6-10, A\u2013B Bites from A, the black widow spider and B, the brown recluse spider can make a person very sick.

FOCUS ON PREVENTION REPELLING THOSE PESTS Insect repellent is used to keep away pests such as mosquitoes and ticks that sting and bite. DEET is the active ingredient in many insect repellents. Insect repellents that contain DEET are available in many different forms, including sprays, lotions and liquids. Using repellent with DEET is safe for most people. However, it is important to follow label directions and take proper precautions (see below). The amount of DEET in insect repellents ranges from less than 10 percent to over 30 percent. The more DEET that a product contains, the longer it will protect from mosquito and tick bites. For example, an insect repellent containing about 24 percent DEET provides about 5 hours of protection. Products with 10 percent DEET are as safe as products with 30 percent DEET when used properly. Precautions to follow when using products containing DEET include: \u25a0 Apply products that contain DEET only once a day. \u25a0 Do not use DEET on infants under 2 months of age. \u25a0 Do not use a product that combines sunscreen with a DEET-containing insect repellent. Sunscreens wash off and need to be reapplied often. DEET does not wash off with water. Repeating applications may increase absorption of the chemical and cause possible toxic effects. Before using insect repellent, check the label carefully for the list of ingredients. If you are unsure whether the product is safe for you and your family to use, ask your health care provider. Use caution when considering insect repellents to be used by pregnant women, infants and children. If you use a repellent, follow these general rules: \u25a0 Keep all repellents out of the reach of children. \u25a0 To apply repellent to the face, \ufb01 rst spray it on your hands and then apply it from your hands to your face. Avoid sensitive areas, such as the lips and eyes. \u25a0 Never use repellents on an open wound or irritated skin. \u25a0 Use repellents sparingly. One application will last 4 to 8 hours. Heavier or more frequent applications do not increase effectiveness. \u25a0 If you suspect that you are having a reaction to a repellent, wash the treated skin immediately and call your health care provider. \u25a0 Never put repellents on children\u2019s hands. They may put them in their eyes or mouth. For current information about pesticides, contact the National Pesticide Information Center at npic.orst. edu or at (800) 858-7378. Scorpions live in dry regions such as the southwestern United States and Mexico. They live under rocks, logs and the bark of certain trees (Fig. 6-11). They are most active at night. Like spiders, only a few species of scorpions have a sting that can cause death. It is dif\ufb01 cult to distinguish highly poisonous scorpions from nonpoisonous scorpions. Therefore, all scorpion stings should be treated as medical emergencies. What to Look For Signals of spider bites depend on the amount of poison, called venom , injected and the person\u2019s sensitivity to the venom. Most spider bites heal with no adverse effects or scarring. Signals of venomous spider bites can seem identical to those of other conditions and therefore can be dif\ufb01 cult to recognize.

What to Do Until Help Arrives If the person has been bitten by a venomous spider or stung by a scorpion: \u25a0 Wash the wound thoroughly. \u25a0 Apply an antibiotic ointment, if the person has no known allergies or sensitivities to the medication, to prevent infection. \u25a0 Bandage the wound. \u25a0 Apply an ice or cold pack to the site to reduce pain and swelling. \u25a0 Encourage the person to seek medical attention. Children and older adults may need antivenin to block the effects of the spider\u2019s venom. \u25a0 If you transport the person to a medical facility, keep the bitten area elevated and as still as possible. Venomous Snake Bites Snakebites kill few people in the United States. Of the estimated 7000 people bitten annually, fewer than 5 die (Fig. 6-12, A\u2013D). Most snakebites occur near the home, not in the wild. Rattlesnakes account for most snakebites, and most of the deaths from snakebites in the United States. Most deaths occur because the bitten person has an allergic reaction, is in poor health or because too much time passes before he or she receives medical care. What to Look For Signals of a possibly venomous snakebite include: \u25a0 A bite mark. \u25a0 Pain. \u25a0 Swelling. When to Call 9-1-1 If the bite is from a venomous snake such as a rattlesnake, copperhead, cottonmouth or coral snake call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. What to Do Until Help Arrives To care for a venomous snake bite: \u25a0 Wash the wound. \u25a0 Apply an elastic (pressure immobilization) bandage to slow the spread of venom through the lymphatic system by following these steps: to be certain that a spider has bitten a person is to have witnessed it. The bite of the black widow spider is the most painful and deadly of the widow spiders, especially in very young children and the elderly. The bite usually causes an immediate sharp pinprick pain, followed by a dull pain in the area of the bite. However, the person often does not know that he or she has been bitten until he or she starts to feel ill or notices a bite mark or swelling. Other signals of a black widow spider bite include: \u25a0 Rigid muscles in the shoulders, chest, back and abdomen. \u25a0 Restlessness. \u25a0 Anxiety. \u25a0 Dizziness. \u25a0 Headache. \u25a0 Excessive sweating. \u25a0 Weakness. \u25a0 Drooping or swelling of the eyelids. The bite of the brown recluse spider may produce little or no pain initially. Pain in the area of the bite develops an hour or more later. A blood-\ufb01 lled blister forms under the surface of the skin, sometimes in a target or bull\u2019s- eye pattern. Over time, the blister increases in size and eventually ruptures, leading to tissue destruction and a black scab. The hobo spider also can produce an open, slow-healing wound.

Animal Bites The bite of a domestic or wild animal can cause infection and soft tissue injury. The most serious possible result is rabies. Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of diseased animals such as skunks, bats, raccoons, cats, dogs, cattle and foxes. Animals with rabies may act strangely. For example, those that are usually active at night may be active in the daytime. A wild animal that usually tries to avoid people might not run from you. Rabid animals may drool, appear to be partially paralyzed, or act aggressively or strangely quiet. If not treated, rabies is fatal. Anyone bitten by an animal that might have rabies must get medical attention. Treatment for rabies includes a series of vaccine injections to build up immunity that will help \ufb01 ght the disease. If an animal bites someone, try to get the person away from the animal without putting yourself in danger. Do not try to stop, hold or catch the animal. Do not touch a pet that may have come in contact with the animal\u2019s saliva without using or wearing some form of protection like disposable gloves.

What to Do Until Help Arrives If you encounter someone who has a marine-life sting: \u25a0 Get a lifeguard to remove the person from the water as soon as possible. If a lifeguard is not available, use a reaching assist, if possible (see Chapter 1). Avoid touching the person with your bare hands, which could expose you to the stinging tentacles. Use gloves or a towel when removing any tentacles. \u25a0 If you know the sting is from a jelly \ufb01 sh, irrigate the injured part with large amounts of vinegar as soon as possible for at least 30 seconds. This can help to remove the tentacles and stop the injection of venom. Vinegar works best to offset the toxin, but a baking soda slurry also may be used if vinegar is not available. \u25a0 If the sting is known to be from a bluebottle jelly\ufb01 sh, also known as a Portuguese man-of-war, use ocean water instead of vinegar. Vinegar triggers further envenomation. \u25a0 Do not rub the wound, apply a pressure immobilization bandage or apply fresh water or other remedies because this may increase pain. \u25a0 Once the stinging action is stopped and tentacles removed, care for pain by hot-water immersion. Have the person take a hot shower if possible for at least 20 minutes. The water temperature should be as hot as can be tolerated (non-scalding) or about 113\u00b0 F if the temperature can be measured. \u25a0 If you know the sting is from a stingray, sea urchin or spiny fish, flush the wound with tap water. Ocean water also may be used. Keep the injured part still and soak the affected area in non-scalding hot water (as hot as the person can stand) for at least 20 minutes or until the pain goes away. If hot water is not available, packing the area in hot sand may have a similar effect if the sand is hot enough. Then carefully clean the wound and apply a bandage. Watch for signals of infection and check with a health care provider to determine if a tetanus shot is needed. POISONOUS PLANTS Every year, millions of people suffer after coming into contact with poisonous plants such as poison ivy, poison sumac and poison oak (Fig. 6-14, A\u2013C).

                "96": "You often can avoid or limit the irritating effects of touching or brushing against poisonous plants by following these steps: \u25a0 Remove exposed clothing and wash the exposed area thoroughly with soap and water as soon as possible after contact. \u25a0 Wash clothing exposed to plant oils since the oils can linger on fabric. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling exposed clothing. Wash your hands after touching exposed pets. \u25a0 Put a paste of baking soda and water on the area several times a day if a rash or weeping sore begins to develop. Calamine lotion and antihistamines, such as Benadryl \u00ae , may help to dry up the sores. \u25a0 See a health care provider if the condition gets worse or involves areas of the face or throat that could affect breathing. He or she may decide to give anti- in\ufb02 ammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids or other medications, to relieve discomfort. LIGHTNING Every year, lightning causes more deaths in the United States than any other weather hazard, including blizzards, hurricanes, \ufb02 oods, tornadoes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The National Weather Service (NWS) estimates that lightning kills nearly 100 people annually and injures about 300 others. Lightning travels at speeds of up to 300 miles per second. Anything tall\u2014a tower, tree or person\u2014can become a path for the electrical current. A lightning strike can throw a person through the air, burn off clothes and cause the heart to stop beating. The most severe lightning strikes carry up to 50 million volts of electricity. This is enough electricity to light 13,000 homes. Lightning can \u201c\ufb02 ash\u201d over a person\u2019s body or it can travel through blood vessels and nerves to reach the ground. If a person survives a lightning strike, he or she may act confused. The person may describe the episode as getting hit on the head or hearing an explosion. Prevent Lightning Injuries What to do before a possible lightning storm : \u25a0 Pick campsites that meet safety precautions. \u25a0 Know local weather patterns, especially in summertime. \u25a0 Plan turnaround times (the amount of time you need to get back) in lightning-prone areas, based on your research, and stick to the plan. During thunderstorms, use common sense to prevent being struck by lightning. If a thunderstorm threatens, the NWS advises people to: \u25a0 Postpone activities immediately, and not wait for rain to begin. Thunder and lightning can strike without rain. \u25a0 Watch cloud patterns and conditions for signs of an approaching storm. \u25a0 Designate safe locations and move or evacuate to a safe location at the \ufb01 rst sound of thunder. Every 5 seconds between the \ufb02 ash of lightning and the sound of thunder equals 1 mile of distance. \u25a0 Where possible, quickly \ufb01 nd shelter in a substantial building (not a carport, open garage or covered patio), or in a fully enclosed metal vehicle, such as a hardtop car (not a convertible), truck or van, with the windows completely shut. \u25a0 Use the 30-30 rule where visibility is good and there is nothing obstructing your view of the thunderstorm. When you see lightning, count the time until you hear thunder. If that time is 30 seconds or less, the thunderstorm is within 6 miles. Seek shelter immediately. The threat of lightning continues for a much longer period than most people realize. Wait at least 30 minutes after the last clap of thunder before leaving shelter. If inside during a storm, keep away from windows. Injuries may occur from \ufb02 ying debris or glass if a window breaks. \u25a0 Stay away from plumbing, electrical equipment and wiring during a thunderstorm. \u25a0 Do not use a corded telephone or radio transmitter except for emergencies. \u25a0 If there is a tornado alert, go to the basement of the lowest interior level of a building. In a lightning storm, reach safety by following these guidelines : \u25a0 Move downhill. \u25a0 Do not stay in a meadow or any other wide-open space. \u25a0 Seek uniform cover, such as low rolling hills or trees of about the same size. \u25a0 If you are boating or swimming, get to land and move away from the shore. \u25a0 Avoid all of the following: { Metal { Anything connected to electrical power { High places and high objects such as tall trees { Open places { Damp, shallow caves and tunnels { Overhangs { Flood zones ",
                "97": "Environmental Emergencies 97 { Places obviously struck by lightning in the past { Long conductors, such as fences If lightning is striking nearby when people are outside, they should assume a safe position : \u25a0 Squat or sit in a tight body position on insulating material such as a sleeping pad or a life jacket (Fig. 6-15). \u25a0 Take off any metal-framed packs and toss hiking poles away from the group. \u25a0 Do not lie down; instead, try to make as little contact with the ground as possible. \u25a0 If you feel your hair stand on end or your skin get tingly, cover your ears with your hands, close your eyes and get your head close to your knees. \u25a0 Avoid squatting or sitting close to other people. Maintain a minimum distance of at least 15 feet between people. Keep everyone in sight if possible. Lightning Injuries Lightning injuries are serious and can be fatal. Being struck by lightning can cause cardiac and pulmonary arrest, neurological problems, blindness, deafness, burns, bone fractures, loss of hearing, eyesight and trauma. What to Look For When checking a person struck by lightning, look the person over from head to toe in the front and back for any of the following signals: \u25a0 Unconsciousness \u25a0 Dazed, confused behavior \u25a0 Trouble breathing \u25a0 No breathing \u25a0 Burn marks on the skin or other open wounds \u25a0 Muscle, bone or joint injuries such as fractures or dislocations When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 immediately if a person is struck by lightning. Even if the person seems to have recovered soon after the incident, advanced medical care still is necessary because serious problems can develop later. What to Do Until Help Arrives \u25a0 Immediately perform CPR if needed. \u25a0 Give care for any injuries as needed including care for thermal burns. \u25a0 Be ready to care for other conditions, such as hypothermia in a wet, injured person. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Outdoor activities in all kinds of weather are healthy and fun, but environmental emergencies can occur. Children and adults become seriously injured, and even die, from heat stroke, hypothermia, snakebites and lightning strikes. The good news is that you can prevent environmental emergencies most of the time. Be prepared for all kinds of weather and situations before you head out to hike, swim, ski or camp. Know how to dress appropriately, what precautions to take and what to do if a situation becomes uncertain. Even with excellent preparation, emergencies still happen. Know the signals\u2014especially the early ones\u2014of environmentally caused illnesses. This will allow you to make quick decisions for yourself or others. Quick decisions about when to call 9-1-1 and when to seek medical care can mean the difference between life and death in an environmental emergency!

When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if: \u25a0 A person complains of severe pain or cannot move a body part without pain. \u25a0 You think the force that caused the injury was great enough to cause serious damage. \u25a0 An injured extremity is blue or extremely pale. \u25a0 The person\u2019s abdomen is tender and distended. \u25a0 The person is vomiting blood or coughing up blood. \u25a0 The person shows signals of shock or becomes confused, drowsy or unconscious. WOUNDS Soft tissues are the layers of skin and the fat and muscle beneath the skin\u2019s outer layer (Fig. 7-1). An injury to the soft tissue commonly is called a wound . Any time the soft tissue is damaged or torn, the body is threatened. Injuries may damage the soft tissue at or near the skin\u2019s surface or deep in the body. Severe bleeding can occur at the skin\u2019s surface or beneath, where it is harder to detect. Germs can enter the body through the wound and cause infection. Wounds usually are classi\ufb01 ed as either closed or open. In a closed wound , the skin\u2019s surface is not broken; therefore, tissue damage and any bleeding occur below the surface. In an open wound , the skin\u2019s surface is broken, and blood may come through the tear in the skin. Fortunately, most of the bleeding you will encounter will not be serious. In most cases it usually stops by itself within a few minutes with minimal intervention. The trauma may cause a blood vessel to tear causing bleeding, but the blood at the wound site usually clots quickly and stops \ufb02 owing. Sometimes, however, the damaged blood vessel is too large or the pressure in the blood vessel is too great for the blood to clot, then bleeding can be life threatening. This can happen with both closed and open wounds. Closed Wounds The simplest closed wound is a bruise. A bruise develops when the body is bumped or hit, such as when you bump your leg on a table or chair (Fig. 7-2). The force of the blow to the body damages the soft tissue layers beneath the skin. This causes internal bleeding. Blood and other \ufb02 uids seep into the surrounding tissues, causing the area to swell and change color. A more serious closed wound can be caused by a violent force hitting the body. This type of force can injure larger blood vessels and deeper layers of muscle tissue, which may result in heavy bleeding beneath the skin and damage to internal organs. What to Look For Signals of internal bleeding include: \u25a0 Tender, swollen, bruised or hard areas of the body, such as the abdomen. \u25a0 Rapid, weak pulse. \u25a0 Skin that feels cool or moist or looks pale or bluish. \u25a0 Vomiting blood or coughing up blood. \u25a0 Excessive thirst. \u25a0 An injured extremity that is blue or extremely pale.

                "100": "What to Do Until Help Arrives Many closed wounds, like bruises, do not require special medical care. To care for a closed wound, you can apply an ice pack to the area to decrease bleeding beneath the skin. Applying cold also can be effective in helping to control both pain and swelling (Fig. 7-3). Fill a plastic bag with ice and water or wrap ice in a wet cloth and apply it to the injured area for periods of about 20 minutes. Place a thin barrier between the ice and bare skin. Remove the ice and wait for 20 minutes before reapplying. If the person is not able to tolerate a 20\u2013minute application, apply the ice pack for periods of 10 minutes on and off. Elevating the injured part may help to reduce swelling; however, do not elevate the injured part if it causes more pain. Do not assume that all closed wounds are minor injuries. Take the time to \ufb01 nd out whether more serious injuries could be present. With all closed wounds, help the person to rest in the most comfortable position possible. In addition, keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. It also is helpful to comfort and reassure the person. Be sure that a person with an injured lower extremity does not bear weight on it until advised to do so by a medical professional. Open Wounds In an open wound, the break in the skin can be as minor as a scrape of the surface layers or as severe as a deep penetration. The amount of bleeding depends on the location and severity of the injury. The four main types of open soft tissue wounds are abrasions, lacerations, avulsions and punctures. Abrasions Abrasions are the most common type of open wound (Fig. 7-4). They usually are caused by something rubbing roughly against the skin. Abrasions do not bleed much. Any bleeding that occurs comes from capillaries (tiny blood vessels). Dirt and germs frequently have been rubbed into this type of wound, which is why it is important to clean and irrigate an abrasion thoroughly with soap and water to prevent infection. Other terms for an abrasion include a scrape, a rug burn, a road rash or a strawberry. Abrasions usually are painful because scraping of the outer skin layers exposes sensitive nerve endings. Lacerations A laceration is a cut in the skin, which commonly is caused by a sharp object, such as a knife, scissors or broken glass (Fig. 7-5). A laceration also can occur when a blunt force splits the skin. Deep lacerations may cut layers of fat and muscle, damaging both nerves and blood vessels. Bleeding may be heavy or there may be none at all. Lacerations are not always painful because damaged nerves cannot send pain signals to the brain. Infection can easily occur with lacerations if proper care is not given. FIGURE 7-5 Laceration FIGURE 7-4 Abrasion FIGURE 7-3 Apply ice to a closed wound to help control pain and swelling. ",
                "101": "Soft Tissue Injuries 101 Avulsions An avulsion is a serious soft tissue injury. It happens when a portion of the skin, and sometimes other soft tissue, is partially or completely torn away (Fig. 7-6). This type of injury often damages deeper tissues, causing signi\ufb01 cant bleeding. Sometimes a violent force may completely tear away a body part, including bone, such as a \ufb01 nger. This is known as an amputation . With amputations, sometimes bleeding is easier to control because the tissues close around the vessels at the injury site. If there is a violent tearing, twisting or crushing of the extremity, the bleeding may be hard to control. Punctures Punctures usually occur when a pointed object, such as a nail, pierces the skin (Fig. 7-7). A gunshot wound is a puncture wound. Puncture wounds do not bleed much unless a blood vessel has been injured. However, an object that goes into the soft tissues beneath the skin can carry germs deep into the body. These germs can cause infections\u2014sometimes serious ones. If the object remains in the wound, it is called an embedded object. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately for any major open or closed wound. FIGURE 7-8 The area around an infected wound becomes swollen and red. Image \u00a9  Fedor Kondratenko, 2010 Used under license from Shutterstock.com. What to Do Until Help Arrives Give general care for all open wounds. Speci\ufb01 c care depends on whether the person has a minor or a major open wound. General Care for Open Wounds General care for open wounds includes controlling bleeding, preventing infection and using dressings and bandages. Preventing Infection When the skin is broken, the best initial defense against infection is to clean the area. For minor wounds, after controlling any bleeding, wash the area with soap and water and, if possible, irrigate with large amounts of fresh running water to remove debris and germs. You should not wash more serious wounds that require medical attention because they involve more extensive tissue damage or bleeding and it is more important to control the bleeding. Sometimes even the best care for a soft tissue injury is not enough to prevent infection. You usually will be able to recognize the early signals of infection. The area around the wound becomes swollen and red (Fig. 7-8). The area may feel warm or throb with pain. Some wounds discharge pus. Serious infections may cause a person to develop a fever and feel ill. Red streaks may develop that progress from the wound toward the heart. If this happens, the infected person should seek immediate professional medical attention. If you see any signals of infection, keep the area clean, soak it in clean, warm water and apply an antibiotic ointment if the person has no known allergies or sensitivities to the medication. Change coverings over the wound daily. FIGURE 7-6 Avulsion FIGURE 7-7 Puncture ",
                "102": "FOCUS ON PREVENTION Tetanus is a severe infection that can result from a puncture or a deep cut. Tetanus is a disease caused by bacteria. These bacteria produce a powerful poison in the body. The poison enters the nervous system and can cause muscle paralysis. Once tetanus reaches the nervous system, its effects are highly dangerous and can be fatal. Fortunately, tetanus often can be successfully treated with medicines called antitoxins . One way to prevent tetanus is through immunizations. All of us need to have a shot to protect against tetanus. We also need a booster shot at least every 10 years. Check with your health care provider to learn whether you need a booster shot if either of the following happens: \u25a0 Your skin is punctured or cut by an object that could carry infection, such as a rusty nail. \u25a0 You are bitten by an animal. TETANUS Determining if the Person Needs Stitches It can be dif\ufb01 cult to judge when a wound requires stitches. One rule of thumb is that a health care provider will need to stitch a wound if the edges of skin do not fall together, the laceration involves the face or when any wound is over 1 \u2044 2 inch long (Fig. 7-9). Stitches speed the healing process, lessen the chances of infection and minimize scarring. They should be placed within the \ufb01 rst few hours after the injury. The following major injuries often require stitches: \u25a0 Bleeding from an artery or uncontrolled bleeding. \u25a0 Wounds that show muscle or bone, involve joints, gape widely, or involve hands or feet. \u25a0 Wounds from large or deeply embedded objects. \u25a0 Wounds from human or animal bites. \u25a0 Wounds that, if left unstitched, could leave conspicuous scars, such as those on the face. Using Dressings and Bandages All open wounds need some type of covering to help control bleeding and prevent infection. These coverings commonly are referred to as dressings and bandages, and there are many types. Dressings are pads placed directly on the wound to absorb blood and other \ufb02 uids and to prevent infection. To minimize the chance of infection, dressings should be sterile. Most dressings are porous, allowing air to circulate to the wound to promote healing. Standard dressings include varying sizes of cotton gauze, commonly ranging from 2 to 4 inches square (Fig. 7-10). Larger dressings are used to cover very large wounds and multiple wounds in one body area. Some dressings have nonstick surfaces to prevent them from sticking to the wound. An occlusive dressing is a bandage or dressing that closes a wound or damaged area of the body and FIGURE 7-9 Wounds to the face could cause scarring and therefore often require stitches. \u00a9 iStockphoto.com/Angie Kohler.

Occlusive dressings help to keep in place medications that have been applied to the affected area. They also help to keep in heat, body \ufb02 uids and moisture. Occlusive dressings are manufactured but can be improvised. An example of an improvised occlusive dressing is plastic wrap secured with medical tape. This type of dressing can be used for certain chest and abdominal injuries. A bandage is any material that is used to wrap or cover any part of the body. Bandages are used to hold dressings in place, to apply pressure to control bleeding, to protect a wound from dirt and infection, and to provide support to an injured limb or body part (Fig. 7-12). Any bandage applied snugly to create pressure on a wound or an injury is called a pressure bandage . You can purchase many different types of bandages, including: \u25a0 Adhesive compresses , which are available in assorted sizes and consist of a small pad of nonstick gauze on a strip of adhesive tape that is applied directly to minor wounds (Fig. 7-13). \u25a0 Bandage compresses , which are thick gauze dressings attached to a bandage that is tied in place. Bandage compresses are specially designed to help control severe bleeding and usually come in sterile packages. \u25a0 Roller bandages , which are usually made of gauze or gauze-like material (Fig. 7-14).

Tie or tape the bandage in place (Fig. 7-15, A\u2013C). \u25a0 Do not cover \ufb01 ngers or toes. By keeping these parts uncovered, you will be able to see if the bandage is too tight (Fig. 7-15, D). If \ufb01 ngers or toes become cold or begin to turn pale, blue or ashen, the bandage is too tight and should be loosened slightly. \u25a0 Apply additional dressings and another bandage if blood soaks through the \ufb01 rst bandage. Do not remove the blood-soaked bandages and dressings. Disturbing them may disrupt the formation of a clot and restart the bleeding. Elastic roller bandages , sometimes called elastic wraps, are designed to keep continuous pressure on a body part (Fig. 7-16). Elastic bandages are available in 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-inch widths. As with roller bandages, the FIGURE 7-16 Elastic roller bandage FIGURE 7-15, A\u2013D To apply a roller bandage: A , Start by securing the bandage in place.

                "105": "Soft Tissue Injuries 105 \ufb01 rst step in using an elastic bandage is to select the correct size of the bandage: a narrow bandage is used to wrap a hand or wrist; a medium-width bandage is used for an arm or ankle and a wide bandage is used to wrap a leg. When properly applied, an elastic bandage may control swelling or support an injured limb, as in the care for a venomous snakebite. However, an improperly applied elastic bandage can restrict blood \ufb02 ow, which is not only painful but also can cause tissue damage if not corrected. To apply an elastic roller bandage: \u25a0 Check the circulation of the limb beyond where you will be placing the bandage by checking for feeling, warmth and color. \u25a0 Place the end of the bandage against the skin and use overlapping turns (Fig. 7-17, A). \u25a0 Gently stretch the bandage as you continue wrapping (Fig. 7-17, B). The wrap should cover a long body section, like an arm or a calf, beginning at the point farthest from the heart. For a joint like a knee or an ankle, use \ufb01 gure-eight turns to support the joint. \u25a0 Check the snugness of the bandaging\u2014a \ufb01 nger should easily, but not loosely, pass under the bandage. \u25a0 Always check the area above and below the injury site for feeling, warmth and color, especially \ufb01 ngers and toes, after you have applied an elastic roller bandage. By checking both before and after bandaging, you will be able to tell if any tingling or numbness is from the bandaging or the injury. Speci\ufb01 c Care Guidelines for Minor Open Wounds In minor open wounds, such as abrasions, there is only a small amount of damage and minimal bleeding. To care for a minor open wound, follow these general guidelines: \u25a0 Use a barrier between your hand and the wound. If readily available, put on disposable gloves and place a sterile dressing on the wound. \u25a0 Apply direct pressure for a few minutes to control any bleeding. \u25a0 Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. If possible, irrigate an abrasion for about 5 minutes with clean, warm, running tap water. \u25a0 Apply an antibiotic ointment to a minor wound if the person has no known allergies or sensitivities to the medication. \u25a0 Cover the wound with a sterile dressing and a bandage or with an adhesive bandage to keep the wound moist and prevent drying. Speci\ufb01 c Care Guidelines for Major Open Wounds A major open wound has serious tissue damage and severe bleeding. To care for a major open wound, you must act at once. Follow these steps: \u25a0 Put on disposable gloves. If you suspect that blood might splatter, you may need to wear eye and face protection. \u25a0 Control bleeding by: { Covering the wound with a dressing and \ufb01 rmly pressing against the wound with a gloved hand until the bleeding stops. { Applying a pressure bandage over the dressing to maintain pressure on the wound and to hold the dressing in place. If blood soaks through the bandage, do not remove the blood-soaked bandages. Instead, add more FIGURE 7-17, A\u2013B A , To apply an elastic bandage: Place the bandage against the skin and use overlapping turns. B , Gently stretch the bandage as you continue wrapping.

                "106": "dressings and bandages and apply additional direct pressure. \u25a0 Continue to monitor the person\u2019s condition. Observe the person closely for signals that may indicate that the person\u2019s condition is worsening, such as faster or slower breathing, changes in skin color and restlessness. \u25a0 Care for shock. Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. \u25a0 Have the person rest comfortably and provide reassurance. \u25a0 Wash your hands immediately after giving care, even if you wore gloves. Using Tourniquets When Help Is Delayed A tourniquet is a tight band placed around an arm or leg to constrict blood vessels in order to stop blood \ufb02 ow to a wound. Because of the potential for adverse effects, a tourniquet should be used only as a last resort in cases of delayed care or situations where response from emergency medical services (EMS) is delayed, when direct pressure does not stop the bleeding or you are not able to apply direct pressure. For example, a tourniquet may be appropriate if you cannot reach the wound because of entrapment, there are multiple injuries or the size of the wound prohibits application of direct pressure. In most areas, application of a tourniquet is considered to be a skill at the emergency medical technician (EMT) level or higher and requires proper training. There are several types of manufactured tourniquets available and are preferred over makeshift (improvised) devices. For a manufactured tourniquet, always follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In general, the tourniquet is applied around the wounded extremity, just above the wound. The tag end of the strap is routed through the buckle, and the strap is pulled tightly, which secures the tourniquet in place. The rod (windlass) then is twisted to tighten the tourniquet until the bright-red bleeding stops. The rod then is secured in place (Fig. 7-18, A\u2013B). The tourniquet should not be removed in the prehospital setting once it is applied. The time that the tourniquet was applied should be noted and recorded and then given to EMS personnel. Blood pressure cuffs sometimes are used as a tourniquet to slow the \ufb02 ow of blood in an upper extremity. Another technique is to use a bandage that is 4 inches wide and six to eight layers deep. Always follow local protocols when the use of a tourniquet is considered. Hemostatic Agents Hemostatic agents generally are substances that speed clot formation by absorbing the excess moisture caused by the bleeding. Hemostatic agents are found in a variety of forms, including treated sponge or gauze pads and powder or granular forms. The powder or granular forms are poured directly on the bleeding vessel, then other hemostatic agents, such as gauze pads, are used in conjunction with direct pressure. Over-the-counter versions of hemostatic bandages are available in addition to hemostatic agents intended for use by professional rescuers. Some are more effective than others. However, because some types present a risk of further injury or tissue damage, the routine use of hemostatic agents in \ufb01 rst aid settings is not recommended. BURNS Burns are a special kind of soft tissue injury. Like other types of soft tissue injury, burns can damage the top layer of skin or the skin and the layers of fat, muscle and bone beneath. FIGURE 7-18, A\u2013B When applying a tourniquet: A , Twist the rod to tighten until bright-red bleeding stops. B , Secure it in place. A B ",
                "107": "Soft Tissue Injuries 107 Burns are classi\ufb01 ed by their depth. The deeper the burn, the more severe it is. The three classi\ufb01 cations of burns are as follows: super\ufb01 cial (sometimes referred to as \ufb01 rst degree) (Fig. 7-19, A), partial thickness (sometimes referred to as second degree) (Fig. 7-19, B) and full thickness (sometimes referred to as third degree) (Fig. 7-19, C). Burns also are classi\ufb01 ed by their source: heat (thermal), chemical, electrical and radiation (such as from the sun). A critical burn requires immediate medical attention. These burns are potentially life threatening, dis\ufb01 guring and disabling. Unfortunately, it often is dif\ufb01 cult to tell if a burn is critical. Even super\ufb01 cial burns can be critical if they affect a large area or certain body parts. You cannot judge a burn\u2019s severity by the person\u2019s level of pain because nerve endings may be destroyed. Be aware that burns to a child or an infant could be caused by child abuse. Burns that are done intentionally to a child often leave an injury that cannot be hidden. One example is a sharp line dividing the burned and unburned skin such as from scalding water in a tub. If you think you have reasonable cause to believe that abuse has occurred, report your suspicions to the appropriate community or state agency. For more information on child abuse, see Chapter 9. What to Look For Signals of burns depend on whether the burn is super\ufb01 cial, partial thickness or full thickness. \u25a0 S uper\ufb01 cial burns : { Involve only the top layer of skin. { Cause skin to become red and dry, usually painful and the area may swell. { Usually heal within a week without permanent scarring. \u25a0 Partial-thickness burns : { Involve the top layers of skin. { Cause skin to become red; usually painful; have blisters that may open and weep clear \ufb02 uid, making the skin appear wet; may appear mottled; and often swells. { Usually heal in 3 to 4 weeks and may scar. \u25a0 Full-thickness burns : { May destroy all layers of skin and some or all of the underlying structures\u2014fat, muscles, bones and nerves. { The skin may be brown or black (charred), with the tissue underneath sometimes appearing white, and can either be extremely painful or relatively painless (if the burn destroys nerve endings). { Healing may require medical assistance; scarring is likely. When to Call 9-1-1 You should always call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the burned person has: \u25a0 Trouble breathing. \u25a0 Burns covering more than one body part or a large surface area. \u25a0 Suspected burns to the airway. Burns to the mouth and nose may be a sign of this. \u25a0 Burns to the head, neck, hands, feet or genitals. \u25a0 A full-thickness burn and is younger than 5 years or older than 60 years. \u25a0 A burn caused by chemicals, explosions or electricity. What to Do Until Help Arrives Care given for burns depends on the type of burn. Heat (Thermal) Burns Follow these basic steps when caring for a heat burn: \u25a0 Check the scene for safety. \u25a0 Stop the burning by removing the person from the source of the burn. \u25a0 Check for life-threatening conditions. FIGURE 7-19, A\u2013C The three classi\ufb01 cations of burns are A , super\ufb01 cial burns, B , partial-thickness burns and C, full-thickness burns.

                "108": "As soon as possible, cool the burn with large amounts of cold running water, at least until pain is relieved (Fig. 7-20, A). \u25a0 Cover the burn loosely with a sterile dressing (Fig. 7-20, B). \u25a0 Take steps to minimize shock. Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. \u25a0 Comfort and reassure the person. \u25a0 Do not apply ice or ice water to any burn. Ice and ice water can cause the body to lose heat rapidly and further damages body tissues. \u25a0 Do not touch a burn with anything except a clean covering. \u25a0 Do not remove pieces of clothing that stick to the burned area. \u25a0 Do not try to clean a severe burn. \u25a0 Do not break blisters. \u25a0 Do not use any kind of ointment on a severe burn. When a person suffers a burn, he or she is less able to regulate body temperature. As a result, a person who has been burned tends to become chilled. To help maintain body temperature and prevent hypothermia, keep the person warm and away from drafts. Remember that cooling a burn over a large area of the body can bring on hypothermia. Be aware of this risk and look for signals of hypothermia. If possible, monitor the person\u2019s core body temperature when cooling a burn that covers a large area. Chemical Burns When caring for chemical burns it is important to remember that the chemical will continue to burn as long as it is on the skin. You must remove the chemical from the skin as quickly as possible. To do so, follow these steps: \u25a0 If the burn was caused by dry chemicals, brush off the chemicals using gloved hands or a towel and remove any contaminated clothing before \ufb02 ushing with tap water (under pressure). Be careful not to get the chemical on yourself or on a different area of the person\u2019s skin. \u25a0 Flush the burn with large amounts of cool running water. Continue \ufb02 ushing the burn for at least 20 minutes or until EMS personnel take over. \u25a0 If an eye is burned by a chemical, \ufb02 ush the affected eye with water until EMS personnel take over. Tilt the head so that the affected eye is lower than the unaffected eye as you \ufb02 ush (Fig. 7-21). \u25a0 If possible, have the person remove contaminated clothes to prevent further contamination while you continue to \ufb02 ush the area. Be aware that chemicals can be inhaled, potentially damaging the airway or lungs. Electrical Burns If you encounter a person with an electrical burn , you should: \u25a0 Never go near the person until you are sure he or she is not still in contact with the power source. \u25a0 Turn off the power at its source and care for any life-threatening conditions. \u25a0 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. Any person who has suffered an electrical shock needs to be evaluated by a medical professional to determine the extent of injury. FIGURE 7-21 If an eye is burned by a chemical, \ufb02 ush the affected eye with water until EMS personnel take over. A FIGURE 7-20 A\u2013B A , Cool a thermal burn with large amounts of cold running water until the pain is relieved. B , Cover a thermal burn loosely with a sterile dressing. B ",
                "109": "Soft Tissue Injuries 109 \u25a0 Be aware that electrocution can cause cardiac and respiratory emergencies. Therefore, be prepared to perform CPR or use an automated external de\ufb01 brillator (AED). \u25a0 Care for shock and thermal burns. \u25a0 Look for entry and exit wounds and give the appropriate care (Fig. 7-22). \u25a0 Remember that anyone suffering from electric shock requires advanced medical care. Radiation Burns Care for a radiation (sun) burn as you would for any thermal burn (Fig. 7-23). Always cool the burn and protect the area from further damage by keeping the person away from the source of the burn. Preventing Burns \u25a0 Heat burns can be prevented by following safety practices that prevent \ufb01 re and by being careful around sources of heat. \u25a0 Chemical burns can be prevented by following safety practices around all chemicals and by following manufacturers\u2019 guidelines when handling chemicals. \u25a0 Electrical burns can be prevented by following safety practices around electrical lines and equipment and by leaving outdoor areas when lightning could strike. \u25a0 Sunburn can be prevented by wearing appropriate clothing and using sunscreen. Sunscreen should have a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. SPECIAL SITUATIONS Certain types of wounds need special attention or care. These types of situations include crush injury; severed body parts (amputations); impaled objects; and injury to the mouth, nose, lip, tooth, chest and abdomen. Crush Injuries A crush injury is caused by strong pressure against a body part, often a limb. It may result in serious damage to underlying tissue, causing bruising, bleeding, lacerations, fractures, shock and internal injuries. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for any serious or life-threatening condition. Care for speci\ufb01 c injuries found and assume that internal injuries are present. Also care for shock. Severed Body Parts If part of the body has been torn or cut off, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, then try to \ufb01 nd the part and wrap it in sterile gauze or any clean material, such as a washcloth. Put the wrapped part in a plastic bag and seal the bag. Keep the part cold and bag cool by placing it in a larger bag or container of an ice and water slurry, not on ice alone and not on dry ice, if possible, but do not freeze (Fig. 7-24). Be sure the part is taken to the hospital with the person. Doctors may be able to reattach it. FIGURE 7-22 For an electrical burn, look for entry and exit wounds and give the appropriate care. FIGURE 7-23 Care for sunburn as you would for any thermal burn. FIGURE 7-24 Wrap a severed body part in sterile gauze, put it in a plastic bag and put the bag on ice. ",
                "110": "Embedded Objects If an object, such as a knife or a piece of glass or metal, is embedded in a wound, do not remove it. Place several dressings around it to keep it from moving (Fig. 7-25). Bandage the dressings in place around the object. If it is only a splinter in the surface of the skin, it can be removed with tweezers. After removing the splinter from the skin, wash the area with soap and water, rinsing the area with tap water for about 5 minutes. After drying the area, apply an antibiotic ointment to the area if the person has no known allergies or sensitivities to the medication and then cover it to keep it clean. If the splinter is in the eye, do not attempt to remove it. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. Nose Injuries Nose injuries usually are caused by a blow from a blunt object, often resulting in a nosebleed. High blood pressure or changes in altitude also can cause nosebleeds. In most cases, you can control bleeding by having the person sit with the head slightly forward while pinching the nostrils together for about 10 minutes (Fig. 7-26). If pinching the nostrils does not control the bleeding, other methods include applying an ice pack to the bridge of the nose or putting pressure on the upper lip just beneath the nose. Remember, ice should not be applied directly to the skin since it can damage the skin tissue. Place a cloth between the ice and the skin. Seek medical attention if the bleeding persists or recurs or if the person says that it is caused by high blood pressure. Mouth Injuries With mouth injuries, you must make sure the person is able to breathe. Injuries to the mouth may cause breathing problems if blood or loose teeth block the airway. If the person is bleeding from the mouth and you do not suspect a serious head, neck or spinal injury, place the person in a seated position leaning slightly forward. This will allow any blood to drain from the mouth. If this position is not possible, place the person on his or her side. Lip Injuries For injuries that penetrate the lip, place a rolled dressing between the lip and the gum. You can place another dressing on the outer surface of the lip. If the tongue is bleeding, apply a dressing and direct pressure. Applying cold to the lips or tongue can help to reduce swelling and ease pain. Tooth Injuries If a person\u2019s tooth is knocked out, control the bleeding and save the tooth so it may possibly be reinserted. When the \ufb01 bers and tissues are torn from the socket, it is important for the person to seek dental or emergency care as soon as possible after the injury. Generally, the sooner the tooth is replaced, the better the chance is that it will survive. If the person is conscious and able to cooperate, rinse out the mouth with cold tap water if available. You can control the bleeding by placing a rolled sterile dressing into the space left by the missing tooth (Fig. 7-27). Have FIGURE 7-25 Place several dressings around an embedded object to keep it from moving. Bandage the dressings in place around the object. FIGURE 7-26 To control a nosebleed, have the person lean forward and pinch the nostrils together until bleeding stops (about 10 minutes).

                "111": "Soft Tissue Injuries 111 the person gently bite down to maintain pressure. To save the tooth, place it in milk, if possible, or cool water if milk is not available. Be careful to pick up the tooth only by the crown (white part) rather than by the root. Chest Injuries The chest is the upper part of the trunk. It is shaped by 12 pairs of ribs. Ten of the pairs attach to the sternum (breastbone) in front and to the spine in back. Two pairs, the \ufb02 oating ribs , attach only to the spine. The rib cage , formed by the ribs, the sternum and the spine, protects vital organs, such as the heart, major blood vessels and the lungs. Also in the chest are the esophagus, trachea and muscles used for respiration. Chest injuries are a leading cause of trauma deaths each year. Injuries to the chest may result from a wide variety of causes, such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports mishaps and crushing or penetrating forces. Chest injuries may involve the bones that form the chest cavity or the organs or other structures in the cavity itself. Chest wounds may be either closed or open. A closed chest wound does not break the skin. Closed chest wounds generally are caused by blunt objects, such as steering wheels. Open chest wounds occur when an object, such as a knife or bullet, penetrates the chest wall. Fractured ribs may break through the skin to cause an open chest injury. Rib fractures usually are caused by direct force to the chest. Puncture wounds to the chest range from minor to life threatening. Stab and gunshot wounds are examples of puncture injuries. The penetrating object can injure any structure or organ within the chest, including the lungs. A puncture injury can allow air to enter the chest through the wound. Air in the chest cavity does not allow the lungs to function normally. Puncture wounds cause varying degrees of internal and external bleeding. A puncture wound to the chest is a life-threatening injury. If the injury penetrates the rib cage, air can pass freely in and out of the chest cavity and the person cannot breathe normally. With each breath the person takes, you will hear a sucking sound coming from the wound. This sound is the primary signal of a penetrating chest injury called a sucking chest wound (Fig. 7-28). Without proper care, the person\u2019s condition will worsen. The affected lung or lungs will fail to function, and breathing will become more dif\ufb01 cult. What to Look For Signals of a serious chest injury include: \u25a0 Trouble breathing. \u25a0 Severe pain at the site of the injury. \u25a0 Flushed, pale, ashen or bluish skin. \u25a0 Obvious deformity, such as that caused by a fracture. \u25a0 Coughing up blood (may be bright red or dark, like coffee grounds). \u25a0 Bruising at the site of a blunt injury, such as that caused by a seat belt. \u25a0 A \u201csucking\u201d noise or distinct sound when the person breathes. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for any open or closed chest wound, especially if the person has a puncture wound to the chest. Also call if the person has trouble breathing or a sucking chest wound, or if you suspect rib fractures. What to Do Until Help Arrives Care for a chest injury depends on the type of injury. Caring for Rib Fractures Although painful, a simple rib fracture is rarely life threatening. Give the person a blanket or pillow to hold against the fractured ribs. Use a sling and binder to hold the person\u2019s arm against the injured side of the chest. Monitor breathing. FIGURE 7-28 If the injury penetrates the rib cage, air can pass freely in and out of the chest cavity and the person cannot breathe normally. ",
                "112": "Caring for a Sucking Chest Wound To care for a sucking chest wound, cover the wound with a large occlusive dressing (Fig. 7-29, A\u2013B). A piece of plastic wrap, or a plastic bag folded several times and placed over the wound, makes an effective occlusive dressing. Tape the dressing in place except for one side or corner, which should remain loose. A taped-down dressing keeps air from entering the wound when the person inhales, and having an open corner allows air to escape when the person exhales. If these materials are not available to use as dressings, use a folded cloth. Take steps to minimize shock. Monitor the person\u2019s breathing. Abdominal Injury Like a chest injury, an injury to the abdomen may be either open or closed. Injuries to the abdomen can be very painful. Even with a closed wound, the rupture of an organ can cause serious internal bleeding, resulting in shock. It is especially dif\ufb01 cult to determine if a person has an internal abdominal injury if he or she is unconscious. Always suspect an abdominal injury in a person who has multiple injuries. What to Look For Signals of serious abdominal injury include: \u25a0 Severe pain. \u25a0 Bruising. \u25a0 External bleeding. \u25a0 Nausea. \u25a0 Vomiting (sometimes blood). \u25a0 Weakness. \u25a0 Thirst. \u25a0 Pain, tenderness or a tight feeling in the abdomen. \u25a0 Organs protruding from the abdomen. \u25a0 Rigid abdominal muscles. \u25a0 Other signals of shock. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for any serious abdominal injury. What to Do Until Help Arrives With a severe open injury, abdominal organs sometimes protrude through the wound (Fig. 7-30, A). To care for an open wound to the abdomen , follow these steps: 1. Put on disposable gloves or use another barrier. 2. Carefully position the person on his or her back with the knees bent, if that position does not cause pain. 3. Do not apply direct pressure. 4. Do not push any protruding organs back into the open wound. 5. Remove clothing from around the wound (Fig. 7-30, B). 6. Apply moist, sterile dressings loosely over the wound (clean, warm tap water can be used) (Fig. 7-30, C). 7. Cover dressings loosely with plastic wrap, if available (Fig. 7-30, D). To care for a closed wound to the abdomen : \u25a0 While keeping the injured area still, apply cold to the affected area to control pain and swelling. \u25a0 Carefully position the person on his or her back with the knees bent, if that position does not cause pain. \u25a0 Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated.

                "117": "Injuries to Muscles, Bones and Joints 117 BACKGROUND The body\u2019s skeleton is made up of bones, muscles, and the tendons and ligaments that connect them. They give the body shape and stability. Bones and muscles give the body shape and mobility. Tendons and ligaments connect to muscle and bones, giving support. They all work together to allow the body to move. Muscles Muscles are soft tissues. The body has over 600 muscles, most of which are attached to bones by strong tissues called tendons (Fig. 8-1). Unlike other soft tissues, muscles are able to shorten and lengthen\u2014contract and relax. This contracting and relaxing enables the body to move. The brain directs the muscles to move through the spinal cord, a pathway of nerves in the spine. Tiny jolts of electricity called electrical impulses travel through the nerves to the muscles. They cause the muscles to contract. When the muscles contract, they pull at the bones, causing motion at a joint. FIGURE 8-1 The body has over 600 muscles, most of which are attached to bones by strong tissues called tendons.

When nerves lose control of muscles, it is called paralysis . When a muscle is injured, a nearby muscle often takes over for the injured one. Bones Approximately 200 bones in various sizes and shapes form the skeleton (Fig. 8-2). The skeleton protects many of the organs inside the body. Bones are hard and dense. Because they are strong and rigid, they are not injured easily. Bones have a rich supply of blood and nerves. Bone injuries can bleed and usually are painful. If care is not given for the injury, the bleeding can become life threatening. Children have more \ufb02 exible bones than adults; their bones break less easily. But if a child sustains a fracture to a growth plate (areas of developing cartilage near the ends of long bones), it can affect future bone growth. Bones weaken with age. Older adults have more brittle bones. Sometimes they break surprisingly easily. This gradual weakening of bones is called osteoporosis . ",
                "118": "Joints The ends of two or more bones coming together at one place form a joint (Fig. 8-3). Strong, tough bands called ligaments hold the bones at a joint together. All joints have a normal range of movement in which they can move freely, without too much stress or strain. When joints are forced beyond this range, ligaments stretch and tear. TYPES OF INJURIES The four basic types of injuries to muscles, bones and joints are fractures, dislocations, sprains and strains. They occur in a variety of ways. Fractures A fracture is a complete break, a chip or a crack in a bone (Fig. 8-4). A fall, a blow or sometimes even a twisting movement can cause a fracture. Fractures are open or closed. An open fracture involves an open wound. It occurs when the end of a bone tears through the skin. An object that goes into the skin and breaks the bone, such as a bullet, also can cause an open fracture. In a closed fracture the skin is not broken.

                "119": "Injuries to Muscles, Bones and Joints 119 FOCUS ON PREVENTION THE BREAKING POINT Osteoporosis is a disease that causes the bones to fracture easily. Approximately 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, and 80 percent of these are women. In 2005, some 2 million spine, hip, wrist and other fractures occurred in the United States because of osteoporosis. People usually have osteoporosis for decades before they experience signals. People do not usually become aware they have this \u201csilent\u201d disease until after the age of 60 years. The disease is caused by a decrease in calcium content of the bones. Normal bones are hard, dense tissues that endure great stresses. Calcium is a key to bone growth, development and repair. When the calcium content of bones decreases, bones become frail and less dense. They are less able to repair the normal damage they incur. This leaves bones, especially hip, back and wrist, more prone to fractures. These fractures may occur with only a little force. Some even occur without force. The person may be taking a walk or washing dishes when the fracture occurs. Risk Factors The risk of an American woman suffering a hip fracture alone is equal to her combined risk of breast, uterine and ovarian cancer. Some risk factors for osteoporosis cannot be changed, including: \u25a0 Being female. \u25a0 Having ancestors from northern Europe, the British Isles, Japan or China. \u25a0 Being of an advanced age. \u25a0 Having a family history of the disease. \u25a0 Having a small, thin body frame. \u25a0 Reaching menopause. However, other risk factors can be changed; there are steps that a person can take to lower the risk of developing osteoporosis. These involve lifestyle choices, including improving diet and exercise, reducing alcohol consumption and stopping smoking. Preventing Osteoporosis Osteoporosis can begin as early as 30 years of age. Building strong bones before age 35 years is the key to preventing osteoporosis. To help prevent osteoporosis, take the following steps: \u25a0 Eat a Well-Balanced Diet. A diet rich in calcium, vitamins and minerals and low in salt is essential for bone health. Limiting caffeine intake and avoiding a high protein diet also are important for bone health. As a person ages, the amount of calcium absorbed from the diet declines, making it more important to have an adequate calcium intake. Calcium is necessary to bone building and maintenance. Three to four daily servings of low-fat dairy products should provide enough calcium for good bone health. Vitamin D also is necessary because it helps the body to absorb the calcium to strengthen bones. Exposure to sunshine enables the body to make vitamin D. People who do not receive adequate exposure to the sun need to eat foods that contain vitamin D. The best sources are vitamin-forti\ufb01 ed milk and fatty \ufb01 sh, such as tuna, salmon and eel. When exposing yourself to the sun, however, you should not risk a burn or deep tan because both increase the risk of skin cancer. \u25a0 Take Vitamins and Supplements if Necessary. People who do not take in adequate calcium may be able to make up for the loss by taking calcium supplements. Some are combined with vitamin D. Before taking a calcium supplement, consult your health care provider. Many highly advertised calcium supplements are ineffective because they do not dissolve in the gastrointestinal tract and cannot be absorbed. An insuf\ufb01 cient intake of phosphorous, magnesium, and vitamins K, B 6 and B 12 also can increase your risk for osteoporosis. To ensure that you are getting enough of these vitamins and minerals, talk to your health care provider about taking a daily multivitamin. \u25a0 Exercise. Exercise also is necessary to building strong bones. Weight-bearing exercise increases bone density and the activity of bone-building cells. Regular exercise may reduce the rate of bone loss by promoting new bone formation. It also may stimulate the ( Continued ) ",
                "120": "Closed fractures are more common, but open fractures are more dangerous because they carry a risk of infection and severe bleeding. In general, fractures are life threatening only if they involve breaks in large bones such as the thigh, sever an artery or affect breathing. Since you cannot always tell if a person has a fracture, you should consider the cause of the injury. A fall from a signi\ufb01 cant height or a motor vehicle crash could signal a possible fracture. Dislocations Dislocations usually are more obvious than fractures. A dislocation is the movement of a bone at a joint away from its normal position (Fig. 8-5). This movement usually is caused by a violent force tearing the ligaments that hold the bones in place. When a bone is moved out of place, the joint no longer functions. The displaced end of the bone often forms a bump, a ridge or a hollow that does not normally exist. Sprains A sprain is the tearing of ligaments at a joint (Fig. 8-6). Mild sprains may swell but usually heal quickly. The person might not feel much pain and is active again soon. If a person ignores the signals of swelling and pain and becomes active too soon, the joint will not heal properly and will remain weak. There is a good chance that it will become reinjured, only this time more severely. A severe sprain also can involve a fracture or dislocation of the bones at the joint. The joints most easily injured are at the ankle, knee, wrist and \ufb01 ngers. FOCUS ON PREVENTION ( Continued ) skeletal system to repair itself. An effective exercise program, such as aerobics, jogging or walking, involves the weight-bearing bones and muscles of the legs. \u25a0 Stop Smoking. Smoking is bad for your bone health since it can block your body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium. The chemicals in cigarettes are bad for bone cells. Also, in women, smoking can block the bone-protective effects of the hormone estrogen , which can affect bone density. \u25a0 Avoid Too Much Alcohol. Alcohol intake should be limited to two drinks a day. Drinking more than this on a regular basis can reduce bone formation. Too much alcohol also can reduce calcium levels in the body. If you have questions about your health and osteoporosis, consult your health care provider. FIGURE 8-5 A dislocation is the movement of a bone at a joint away from its normal position. FIGURE 8-6 A sprain is the tearing of ligaments at a joint. ",
                "121": "Injuries to Muscles, Bones and Joints 121 Strains A strain is a stretching and tearing of muscles or tendons (Fig. 8-7). Strains often are caused by lifting something heavy or working a muscle too hard. They usually involve the muscles in the neck, back, thigh or the back of the lower leg. Some strains can reoccur, especially in the neck and back. What to Look For Always suspect a severe injury when any of the following signals are present: \u25a0 There is pain. One of the most common signals in any muscle, bone or joint injury is pain. The injured area may be very painful to touch and move. \u25a0 There is signi\ufb01 cant bruising and swelling. The area may be swollen and red or bruised. \u25a0 There is signi\ufb01 cant deformity. The area may be twisted or strangely bent (Fig. 8-8). It may have abnormal lumps, ridges and hollows. \u25a0 The person is unable to use the affected part normally. \u25a0 There are bone fragments sticking out of a wound. \u25a0 The person feels bones grating or the person felt or heard a snap or pop at the time of injury. \u25a0 The injured area is cold, numb and tingly. \u25a0 The cause of the injury suggests that it may be severe. It can be dif\ufb01 cult to tell if an injury is to a muscle, bone or joint. Sometimes an x-ray, computer assisted tomography (CAT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to determine the extent of the injury. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number for the following situations: \u25a0 There is obvious deformity. \u25a0 There is moderate or severe swelling and discoloration. \u25a0 Bones sound or feel like they are rubbing together. \u25a0 A snap or pop was heard or felt at the time of the injury. \u25a0 There is a fracture with an open wound at, or bone piercing through, the injury site. \u25a0 The injured person cannot move or use the affected part normally. \u25a0 The injured area is cold and numb. \u25a0 The injury involves the head, neck or spine. \u25a0 The injured person has trouble breathing. \u25a0 The cause of the injury suggests that the injury may be severe. \u25a0 It is not possible to safely or comfortably move the person to a vehicle for transport to a hospital. What to Do Until Help Arrives General care for injuries to muscles, bone and joints includes following the mnemonic RICE: \u25a0 R est\u2014Do not move or straighten the injured area. \u25a0 I mmobilize\u2014Stabilize the injured area in the position it was found. Splint the injured part only if the person must be moved or transported to receive medical care and it does not cause more pain (see Splinting an Injury). Minimizing movement can prevent further injury. \u25a0 C old\u2014Fill a plastic bag with ice and water or wrap ice with a damp cloth and apply ice to the injured area for periods of about 20 minutes (Fig. 8-9). Place a thin barrier between the ice and bare skin. If 20-minute icing cannot be tolerated, apply ice for periods of 10 minutes. If continued icing is needed, remove the pack for 20 minutes, and then replace it. Cold reduces internal bleeding, pain and swelling. Do not apply heat as there is no evidence that applying heat helps muscle, bone or joint injuries. FIGURE 8-7 A strain is a stretching and tearing of muscles or tendons. FIGURE 8-8 A severely injured bone or joint may appear to be deformed. ",
                "122": "E levate\u2014Elevate the injured part only if it does not cause more pain. Elevating the injured part may help reduce swelling. Some injuries, such as a broken \ufb01 nger, may not require you to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, yet they still need medical attention. When transporting the person to a medical facility, have someone else drive. This way you can keep an eye on the person and give care if needed. Injuries to the pelvis, hip or thigh can be life threatening. A person with such an injury should not be moved unnecessarily. Minimizing movement until EMS personnel take over can help to prevent the injury from becoming worse. Splinting an Injury Splinting is a method of immobilizing an injured part to minimize movement and prevent further injury and should be used only if you have to move or transport the person to seek medical attention and if it does not cause more pain. Splint an injury in the position in which you \ufb01 nd it. For fractures, splint the joints above and below the site of the injury. For sprains or joint injuries, splint the bones above and below the site of the injury. If you are not sure if the injury is a fracture or a sprain, splint both the bones and joints above and below the point of injury. Splinting materials should be soft or padded for comfort. Check for circulation (feeling, warmth and color) before and after splinting to make sure that the splint is not too tight. There are many methods of splinting, including: \u25a0 Anatomic splints. The person\u2019s body is the splint. For example, you can splint an arm to the chest or an injured leg to the uninjured leg (Fig. 8-10). \u25a0 Soft splints. Soft materials, such as a folded blanket, towel, pillow or folded triangular bandage, can be used for the splint (Fig. 8-11). A sling is a speci\ufb01 c kind of soft splint that uses a triangular bandage tied to support an injured arm, wrist or hand. \u25a0 Rigid splints. Padded boards, folded magazines or newspapers, or padded metal strips that do not have any sharp edges can serve as splints (Fig. 8-12). \u25a0 The ground . An injured leg stretched out on the ground is supported by the ground. FIGURE 8-9 Applying ice can help to control swelling and reduce pain. FIGURE 8-10 An anatomic splint uses a part of the body as the splint. FIGURE 8-11 Folded blankets, towels, pillows or a triangular bandage tied as a sling can be used as soft splints. FIGURE 8-12 Commercially made rigid splints are available (shown), but many items, such as padded boards or folded newspapers, can be used. ",
                "123": "Injuries to Muscles, Bones and Joints 123 After you have splinted the injury, apply ice to the injured area. Keep the person from getting chilled or overheated and be reassuring. Head, Neck and Spinal Injuries Although head, neck and spinal injuries make up only a small fraction of all injuries, these injuries may be life threatening or cause permanent life-altering damage. Each year, approximately 12,000 Americans suffer a spinal cord injury. Most are male victims with an average age of about 40 years. The leading causes of spinal cord injuries are motor vehicle crashes, followed by falls, violence and sports (Fig. 8-13). Injuries to the head, neck or spine can cause paralysis, speech or memory problems or other disabling conditions. These injuries can damage bone and soft tissue, including the brain and spinal cord. Since generally only x-rays, CAT scans or MRIs can show the severity of a head, neck or spinal injury, you should always care for such injuries as if they were serious. An injury to the brain can cause bleeding inside the skull (Fig. 8-14). The blood can build up and cause pressure, resulting in more damage. The \ufb01 rst and most important signal of brain injury is a change in the person\u2019s level of consciousness. He or she may be dizzy or confused or may become unconscious. The spine is a strong, \ufb02 exible column of small bones that support the head and trunk (Fig. 8-15, A\u2013C). The spinal cord runs through the circular openings of the small bones called the vertebrae . The vertebrae are separated from each other by cushions of cartilage called disks . Nerves originating in the brain form branches extending to various parts of the body through openings in the vertebrae. Injuries to the spine can fracture vertebrae and tear ligaments. In some cases, the vertebrae can shift and cut or squeeze the spinal cord. This can paralyze the person or be life threatening. What to Look For When you encounter an injured person, try to determine if there is a head, neck or spinal injury. Think about whether the forces involved were great enough to cause one of these injuries. Someone may have fallen from a signi\ufb01 cant height or struck his or her head while diving. He or she might have been in a motor vehicle crash and had not been wearing a safety belt. Maybe the person was thrown from the vehicle. Perhaps the person was struck by lightning, or maybe a bullet that pierced his or her back struck the spine. Always suspect FIGURE 8-13 The leading causes of spinal cord injuries are motor vehicle crashes, followed by falls, violence and sports.

Pressure builds within the skull as blood accumulates, causing brain injury. ",
                "124": "a head, neck or spinal injury if a person is unconscious and/or if his or her safety helmet is broken. You also should suspect a head, neck or spinal injury if the injured person: \u25a0 Was involved in a motor vehicle crash or subjected to another signi\ufb01 cant force. \u25a0 Was injured as a result of a fall from greater than a standing height. \u25a0 Is wearing a safety helmet that is broken. \u25a0 Complains of neck or back pain. \u25a0 Has tingling or weakness in the extremities. \u25a0 Is not fully alert. \u25a0 Appears to be intoxicated. \u25a0 Appears to be frail or older than 65 years. \u25a0 Is a child younger than 3 years with evidence of a head or neck injury. When to Call 9-1-1 If you think a person has a head, neck or spinal injury, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. What to Do Until Help Arrives While you are waiting for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to arrive, the best care you can give is to minimize movement of the person\u2019s head, neck and spine. As long as the person is breathing normally, support the head and neck in the position FIGURE 8-15, A\u2013C A, Vertebrae are separated by cushions of cartilage called disks.

                "125": "Injuries to Muscles, Bones and Joints 125 found. Do this by placing your hands on both sides of the person\u2019s head in the position in which you found it. Support the person\u2019s head in that position until EMS personnel take over supporting the person\u2019s head (Fig. 8-16). If the head is sharply turned to one side, do not move it. Support the head and neck in the position found. If a person with a suspected head, neck or spinal injury is wearing a helmet, do not remove it unless you are speci\ufb01 cally trained to do so and it is necessary to assess or access the person\u2019s airway. Minimize movement using the same manual technique you would use if the person were not wearing headgear. The person may become confused, drowsy or unconscious. Breathing may stop. The person may be bleeding. If the person is unconscious, keep the airway open and check breathing. You should take steps to control severe bleeding and keep the person from getting chilled or overheated. Concussion A concussion is a type of brain injury that involves a temporary loss of brain function resulting from a blow to the head. A person with a concussion may not always lose consciousness. The effects of a concussion can appear immediately or very soon after the blow to the head and include sleep, mood and cognitive disturbances, and sensitivity to light and noise. However, some effects do not appear for hours or even days and may last for several days or even longer. When to Call 9-1-1 Every suspected concussion should be treated seriously\u2014call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. What to Look For Signals of a concussion include: \u25a0 Confusion, which may last from moments to several minutes. \u25a0 Headache. \u25a0 Repeated questioning about what happened. \u25a0 Temporary memory loss, especially for periods immediately before and after the injury. \u25a0 Brief loss of consciousness. \u25a0 Nausea and vomiting. \u25a0 Speech problems (patient is unable to answer questions or obey simple commands). \u25a0 Blurred vision or light sensitivity. What to Do Until Help Arrives To care for a person with a suspected concussion: \u25a0 Support the head and neck in the position in which you found it. \u25a0 Maintain an open airway. \u25a0 Control any bleeding and apply dressings to any open wounds. \u25a0 Do not apply direct pressure if there are any signs of an obvious skull fracture. \u25a0 If there is clear \ufb02 uid leaking from the ears or a wound in the scalp, cover the area loosely with a sterile gauze dressing. \u25a0 Monitor the person for any changes in condition. \u25a0 Try to calm and reassure the person. Encourage the person to talk with you; it may prevent loss of consciousness. Chest Injuries Injuries to the chest may be caused by falls, sports mishaps or crushing or penetrating forces. Chest injuries range from a simple broken rib to serious life-threatening injuries. What to Look For Although painful, a simple broken rib rarely is life threatening. A person with a broken rib generally remains calm. However, a person with a broken rib will take small, shallow breaths because normal or deep breathing is uncomfortable or painful. The person usually will attempt to ease the pain by supporting the injured area with a hand or arm. If the injury is serious, the person will have trouble breathing. The person\u2019s skin may appear \ufb02 ushed, pale or ashen and he or she may cough up blood. Remember that a person with a serious chest injury also may have a spinal injury. Broken ribs are less common in children because children\u2019s ribs are more \ufb02 exible and tend to bend rather than break. However, the forces that can cause a broken rib in adults can severely bruise the lung tissue of children, which can be a life-threatening injury. Look for signals, such as what caused the injury, bruising on the chest and trouble breathing, to determine if a child has potential chest injury. FIGURE 8-16 Place your hands on both sides of the person\u2019s head and support it in the position in which you found it until EMS personnel take over. ",
                "126": "When to Call 9-1-1 If you think that the injury is serious, involves trouble breathing or the spine also has been injured, do not move the person and call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. If the person is standing, do not have the person lie down. Continue to watch the person and minimize movement until EMS personnel take over. What to Do Until Help Arrives If you suspect injured or broken ribs, have the person rest in a position that will make breathing easier. Binding the person\u2019s upper arm to the chest on the injured side will help to support the injured area and make breathing more comfortable. You can use an object, such as a pillow or rolled blanket, to support and immobilize the area (Fig. 8-17). Monitor breathing and skin condition, and take steps to minimize shock. Pelvic Injuries The large, heavy bones of the hip make up the pelvis . Like the chest, injury to the pelvic bones can range from simple to life threatening. What to Look For An injury to the pelvis may be serious or life threatening because of the risk of damage to major arteries or internal organs. Fractures of bones in this area may cause severe internal bleeding. Signals of a pelvic injury include the following: \u25a0 Severe pain. \u25a0 Bruising. \u25a0 Possible external bleeding. \u25a0 Nausea. \u25a0 Vomiting (which may include blood). \u25a0 Weakness. \u25a0 Thirst. \u25a0 Tenderness or a tight feeling in the abdomen. \u25a0 Possible loss of sensation in the legs or inability to move the legs. Be alert for the signals of shock, which could indicate internal bleeding and/or blood loss. Signals of shock include: \u25a0 Nausea and vomiting \u25a0 Restlessness or irritability. \u25a0 Altered level of consciousness. \u25a0 Pale, ashen or grayish, cool, moist skin. \u25a0 Rapid breathing and pulse. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if you suspect a pelvic injury. What to Do Until Help Arrives Because an injury to the pelvis also can involve injury to the lower spine, it is best not to move the person. If possible, try to keep the person lying \ufb02 at. Watch for signals of internal bleeding and take steps to minimize shock until EMS personnel take over. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Most of the time, injuries to muscles, bones and joints are painful but not life threatening. Be prepared to recognize signals of these types of injuries. The general care for a muscle, bone or joint injury is to minimize movement of the injured area, follow the RICE mnemonic and make sure that the person gets medical care in a timely manner. Although head, neck and spinal injuries make up only a small fraction of all injuries, these injuries may be life threatening or cause permanent life-altering damage. Recognizing signals of these types of injuries, calling 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and knowing how to give proper care could save a life or prevent further injury.

For example, children, older adults, persons with disabilities and persons who speak a different language than your own have special needs and considerations that affect the care you give. In some emergencies, special circumstances, such as an emergency childbirth or a hostile situation, create additional challenges. In any case, there are steps you can take to be better prepared to respond appropriately. In this chapter, you will explore ways to recognize and respond to special situations and circumstances. This will help you to better understand the nature of the emergency and give appropriate, effective care. ",
                "136": "CHILDREN AND INFANTS Children and infants have unique needs that require special care. For example, checking the condition of a conscious child or infant can be dif\ufb01 cult, especially if the child does not know you. At certain ages, children and infants do not readily accept strangers. Very young children and in fants cannot tell you what is wrong. Communication We tend to react more strongly and emotionally to a child who is in pain or terri\ufb01 ed. In such a situation, try hard to remain calm and avoid showing panic or fear through your actions, speech or facial expressions. Doing so will help both the child and concerned adults. To help an injured or ill child, try to imagine how the child might feel. A child is afraid of the unknown. This includes being ill or hurt, touched by strangers and being separated from his or her parents. Try not to separate the child or infant from loved ones, if possible. Often a parent will be holding a crying child or an infant, in which case, you perform your assessment while the adult continues to hold him or her. How you interact with an injured or ill child or infant is very important. You need to reduce the child\u2019s anxiety and panic and gain the child\u2019s trust and cooperation, if possible. Approach the child slowly. Your sudden appearance may upset the child or infant. Get as close to eye level of the child or infant as you can and keep your voice calm (Fig. 9-1). Smile at the child. Ask the child\u2019s name and use it when you talk with him or her. Talk slowly and dis tinctly, and use words the child will easily under stand. Ask questions that the child will be able to an swer easily. Explain to the child and the parent what you are going to do. Reassure the child that you are there to help and will not leave. To be able to effectively check children and infants, it is helpful to be aware of certain characteristics of children in speci\ufb01 c age groups. It also is important to communicate effectively with parents. In addition, your care will be more effective if you know how to address the speci\ufb01 c communication issues of a child with special needs. Characteristics of Children and Infants Children up to 1 year of age are commonly referred to as infants . Infants younger than 6 months are relatively easy to approach and are unlikely to be fearful of strangers. However, older infants often show \u201cstranger anxiety.\u201d They may turn away from you, cry and cling to their parent. If the parent is calm and cooperative, ask for his or her assistance. Try to check the infant while he or she is held by or seated in the parent\u2019s lap. One- and 2-year-old children commonly are referred to as toddlers . Toddlers may not cooperate with your attempts to check them. They usually are con cerned about being separated from a loved one. If you reassure the toddler that he or she will not be separated from the parent, the toddler may be comforted. If possible, give the toddler a few minutes to get used to you before at tempting to check him or her, and check the toddler in the parent\u2019s lap. A toddler also may respond to praise or be comforted by holding a special toy or blanket. Three- to 5-year-old children commonly are referred to as preschoolers . Children in this age group usually are easy to check if you make use of their natural curiosity. Allow them to inspect items such as bandages. Opportunities to explore can reduce children\u2019s fears and distract them while you are checking them and giving care. Reassure the child that you are going to help and will not leave him or her. Some times you can show what you are going to do on a stuffed animal or doll (Fig. 9-2). If the child is injured, he or she may be upset by seeing FIGURE 9-1 To communicate with a child, get as close to eye level as you can. FIGURE 9-2 Demonstrating \ufb01 rst aid steps on a stuffed animal or doll helps a child to understand how you will care for him or her. ",
                "137": "Special Situations and Circumstances 137 the cut or injury, so cover it with a dressing as soon as possible. School-age children are between 6 and 12 years of age. They often are more comfortable speaking with adults and can be a good source of information concerning what happened. Usually you can talk readily with school-age chil dren. However, do not expect a child to always behave in a way that is consistent with his or her chronological age. Be especially careful not to \u201ctalk down\u201d to school-age children. Let them know if you are going to do anything that may be painful. Children in this age group are becoming conscious of their bodies and may not like exposure. Respect their modesty. Children between 13 and 18 years of age are considered adolescents. Typically they behave more like adults than children. Direct your questions to the adolescent rather than to a parent but allow input from a parent. Adolescents are modest and often react better to a responder of the same gender. Interacting with Parents, Guardians and Caregivers If the family is excited or agitated, the child is likely to be so. When you can calm the family, the child often will calm down as well. Remember to get con sent to give care from any adult responsible for the child when possible. Concerned adults need your support too, so behave as calmly as possible. Communicating with Children Who Have Special Health Care Needs When communicating with children and parents, remember to observe the whole situation and ask questions to determine if the child has special physical or developmental needs. If the child has special needs, ask the parent or caregiver if there is a list summarizing vital emergency information such as any unique or speci\ufb01 c care procedures associated with the child\u2019s condition or allergies and other medical problems or issues. Generally, the parents and caregivers can give you the best information since they are the most familiar with any medical equipment needed by the child. When you attempt to communicate with children who have a developmental disability, the child\u2019s age and developmental level may not be obvious. Do not assume the child has a mental disability because he or she is unable to express thoughts or words. Ask the parents what the child is capable of understanding. Speak directly to the child. Do not speak to the parents as if the child is not in the room. Observing Children and Infants You can obtain a lot of information by observing children or infants before actually touching them. Look for signals that indicate changes in the level of consciousness, trouble breathing, and apparent injuries and conditions. Realize that the situation may change as soon as you touch the child or infant because he or she may become anxious or up set. Unlike some injured or ill adults, a child or an infant is unlikely to try to cover up or deny how he or she feels. A child or an infant in pain, for example, generally will let you know that he or she hurts and will point out the source of the pain. Ask a young child to point to any place that hurts. An older child can tell you the location of painful areas. If you need to hold an in fant, always support the head when you pick up the infant. If a child becomes extremely upset, conduct your check from toe to head instead of head to toe. For more information on checking a child or an infant see Chapter 1. Common Childhood Injuries and Illnesses Certain problems are unique to children, such as speci\ufb01 c kinds of injury and illness. The following sections highlight some of these concerns. Abdominal Pain Abdominal pain in children can be the signal of a large range of conditions. Fortunately, most are not serious and usually go away on their own. What to Look For Abdominal pain accompanied by any of the following signals could indicate that the child is suffering from a serious condition or illness: \u25a0 A sudden onset of severe abdominal pain or pain that becomes worse with time \u25a0 Excessive vomiting or diarrhea \u25a0 Blood in the vomit or stool \u25a0 Bloated or swollen abdomen \u25a0 A change in the child\u2019s level of consciousness, such as drowsiness or confusion \u25a0 Signals of shock When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if you think the child has a life-threatening condition. ",
                "138": "What to Do Until Help Arrives \u25a0 Help the child rest in a comfortable position. \u25a0 Keep the child from becoming chilled or overheated. \u25a0 Comfort and reassure the child. \u25a0 Give care based on any conditions found. Child Abuse At some point, you may encounter a situation in volving an injured child in which you have reason to suspect child abuse. Child abuse is the physical, psychological or sexual assault of a child resulting in injury and emotional trauma. Child abuse in volves an injury or a pattern of injuries that do not result from an accident. Child neglect is a type of child abuse in which the parent or guardian fails to provide the necessary age-appropriate care to a child. What to Look For The signals of child abuse include: \u25a0 An injury whose cause does not \ufb01 t the explanation of the parent, guardian or caregiver. \u25a0 Obvious or suspected fractures in a child younger than 2 years. \u25a0 Any unexplained fractures. \u25a0 Injuries in various stages of healing, especially bruises and burns. \u25a0 Bruises and burns in unusual shapes, such as bruises shaped like belt buckles or handprints or burns the size of a cigarette tip. \u25a0 Unexplained lacerations or abrasions, especially to the mouth, lips and eyes. \u25a0 Injuries to the genitalia. \u25a0 Pain when the child sits down. \u25a0 A larger number of injuries than is common for a child of the same age. The signals of child neglect include: \u25a0 Lack of adult supervision. \u25a0 A child who looks malnourished. \u25a0 An unsafe living environment. \u25a0 Untreated chronic illness (e.g., a child with asthma who has no medications). Giving Care When caring for a child who may have been abused or neglected, your \ufb01 rst priority is to care for the child\u2019s injuries or illnesses. An abused child may be frightened, hysterical or withdrawn. He or she may be unwilling to talk about the incident in an attempt to protect the abuser. If you suspect abuse, explain your concerns to responding police of\ufb01 cers or emergency medical services (EMS) personnel if possible. If you think you have reasonable cause to believe that abuse has occurred, report your suspicions to a community or state agency, such as the Department of Social Services, the Department of Child and Family Services or Child Protective Services. You may be afraid to report suspected child abuse because you do not wish to get involved or are concerned about being sued. However, in most states, when you make a report in good faith, you are immune from any civil or criminal liability or penalty, even if you made a mistake. In this instance, good faith means that you honestly believe that abuse has occurred or the potential for abuse exists and a prudent and reasonable person in the same position would also honestly believe that abuse has occurred or the potential for abuse exists. You do not need to identify yourself when you report child abuse, although your report will have more credibility if you do. In some areas, certain professions are legally obligated to report suspicions of child abuse such as daycare workers or school employees. For more information on reporting child abuse at your workplace, contact your supervisor. Colic Colic is a condition in which an otherwise healthy infant cries more than 3 hours a day, for more than 3 days a week, between the ages of 3 weeks and 3 months. The crying usually starts suddenly at about the same time each day. Colic generally starts to improve at about 6 weeks. It often disappears by the time a baby is 12 weeks old. Causes of colic may include intestinal gas, food sensitivity or allergy, or an immature nervous system. A baby with colic may have a red face and tense, hard belly because the stomach muscles tighten during crying. A baby with colic also may clench his or her legs, feet and \ufb01 sts when crying. Giving Care Movement, including walking and driving in a car, may help. White noise, such as the sound of a vacuum in the next room or the clothes dryer, also may be helpful. You also can hold the baby using certain techniques to help relieve gas pain. Consult your health care provider to rule out more serious medical conditions. Conjunctivitis Conjunctivitis is commonly known as \u201cpink eye.\u201d It is a common childhood eye infection that is contagious. Signals, found in one or both eyes, include redness, swelling, itchiness, a gritty feeling, tearing and a discharge that forms a crust during the night. Seek care from a health care provider as soon as possible for diagnosis. Medication is necessary when the cause of the infection is bacterial. ",
                "139": "Special Situations and Circumstances 139 Diarrhea and Vomiting Diarrhea, or loose stools, often accompanies an infection in children. Vomiting can be frightening for a young child, but it is rarely a serious problem. However, diarrhea and vomiting both can lead to dehydration. This is more likely to occur in young children. When to Seek Professional Medical Care A health care provider should be contacted if: \u25a0 Diarrhea or vomiting persists for more than a few days. \u25a0 The child is not replacing lost liquids or cannot retain liquids. \u25a0 The child has not had a wet diaper in 3 or more hours or, if older, has not had any urine output for more than 6 hours. \u25a0 The child has a high fever. \u25a0 The child has bloody or black stools. \u25a0 The child is unusually sleepy, drowsy, unresponsive or irritable. \u25a0 The child cries without tears or has a dry mouth. \u25a0 The child has a sunken appearance to the abdomen, eyes or cheeks, or, in a very young infant, has a sunken soft spot at the top of the head. \u25a0 The child has skin that remains \u201ctented\u201d if pinched and released. Giving Care Remember the following when caring for children and infants with diarrhea : \u25a0 If the infant will not tolerate his or her normal feedings or if a child is drinking less \ufb02 uid than normal, add a commercially available oral rehydration solution specially designed for children and infants. \u25a0 Do not give over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medications to children younger than 2 years. Use these with the guidance of the health care provider in older children. \u25a0 Maintain the child\u2019s normal diet. Try to limit sugar and arti\ufb01 cial sweeteners. In addition, encourage the child to eat items like bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. Remember the following when caring for children and infants who are vomiting : \u25a0 For a very young child or infant, lay the child on his or her side so that the child does not swallow or inhale the vomit. \u25a0 Halt solid foods for 24 hours during an illness involving vomiting and replace with clear \ufb02 uids, such as water, popsicles, gelatin or an oral rehydration solution specially designed for children and infants. \u25a0 Introduce liquids slowly. For instance, wait 2 to 3 hours after a vomiting episode to offer the child some cool water. Offer 1 to 2 ounces every half hour, four times. Then alternate 2 ounces of rehydration solution with 2 ounces of water every 2 hours. \u25a0 After 12 to 24 hours with no vomiting, gradually reintroduce the child\u2019s normal diet. Ear Infections Ear infections are common in young children. Nearly 90 percent of young children have an ear infection at some time before they reach school age. What to Look For Common signals of an ear infection include: \u25a0 Pain. Older children can tell you that their ears hurt, but younger children may only cry or be irritable or tug on the affected ear. \u25a0 Loss of appetite. \u25a0 Trouble sleeping. \u25a0 Fever. \u25a0 Ear drainage. \u25a0 Trouble hearing. When to Seek Professional Medical Care A health care provider should be contacted if: \u25a0 The child\u2019s signals last longer than a day. \u25a0 You see a discharge of blood or pus from the ear. This could indicate a ruptured eardrum. \u25a0 The child\u2019s signals do not improve or get worse after he or she has been diagnosed by a health care provider. Giving Care Pain symptoms may be treated with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. In children younger than 2 years, watch for sleeplessness and irritability during or after an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold. Always consult the child\u2019s health care provider before giving any over-the-counter pain relievers. Fever Fever is an elevated body temperature of 100.4 \u00b0 F or greater. Fever indicates a problem, and in a child or an infant, it often means there is a speci\ufb01 c problem. Usually these problems are not life threatening, but some can be. A high fever in a child or an infant often indicates some form of infection. In a young child, even a minor infection can result in a high fever, usually de\ufb01 ned as a temperature 103 \u00b0 F and above. Fevers that last a long time or are very high can result in seizures. A febrile seizure is a convulsion brought on by a fever in infants or small children. It is the most common type of seizure in children. Most ",
                "140": "febrile seizures last less than 5 minutes and are not life threatening. However, there are conditions where the child may require additional care (see When to Call 9-1-1 for more information on febrile seizures). Immediately after a febrile seizure, it is important to cool the body if a fever is present (see Chapter 5 for more information on signals of and care for seizures). What to Look For Older children with fever will often: \u25a0 Feel hot to the touch. \u25a0 Complain of being cold or chilled. \u25a0 Complain of body aches. \u25a0 Have a headache. \u25a0 Have trouble sleeping or sleep more than usual. \u25a0 Appear drowsy. \u25a0 Have no appetite. Infants with fever will often: \u25a0 Be upset or fussy, with frequent crying. \u25a0 Be unusually quiet. \u25a0 Feel warm or hot. \u25a0 Breathe rapidly and have a rapid heart rate. \u25a0 Stop eating or sleeping normally. Taking a Temperature If children or infants have any of the signals listed above, you will need to take their temperature to determine if they have a fever. A rectal temperature gives the most reliable reading for children younger than 5 years. ( NOTE : Before taking a rectal temperature, child care providers should make sure that doing so is not prohibited by state regulations.) For children age 5 and older, an oral temperature (in the mouth and under the tongue) is the recommended method. You also may take an oral temperature for children age 3 and older. A child\u2019s or an infant\u2019s temperature also can be taken in the ear (known as the tympanic method ) or under the armpit (known as the axillary method ). Multiple types of thermometers are available. Do not use glass thermometers, and, whenever possible, use an electronic (digital) thermometer. Also, use a thermometer that is speci\ufb01 cally designed for the type of temperature being taken. For example, do not use an oral thermometer to take a rectal temperature. Read the manufacturer\u2019s directions carefully so you know how to use the thermometer appropriately. Always stay with a child while taking a temperature to make sure that the child does not move so the thermometer does not break or cause injury. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the child or infant has signals of life-threatening conditions, such as unconsciousness or trouble breathing. Also, call if this is the \ufb01 rst time that a child has had a febrile seizure, the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or is repeated, or the seizure is followed by a quick rise in the temperature of the child or infant. Child care providers should follow state or local regulations regarding emergency care and contact procedures whenever a child in their care becomes injured or ill. When to Seek Professional Medical Care A health care provider should be contacted for: \u25a0 Any infant younger than 3 months with a fever (100.4 \u00b0 F or greater). \u25a0 Any child younger than 2 years with a high fever (103 \u00b0 F or greater). \u25a0 Any child or infant who has a febrile seizure. Giving Care If the child or infant has a fever, make him or her as comfortable as possible. Encourage the child to rest. Make sure that the child or infant is not overdressed or covered with too many blankets. A single layer of clothing and a light blanket usually is all that is necessary. Make sure that the child or infant drinks clear \ufb02 uids (e.g., water, juice or chicken broth) or continues nursing or bottle-feeding to prevent dehydration. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be given for a fever. Do not give the child aspirin for fever or other signals of \ufb02 u-like or other viral illness. For a child, taking aspirin can result in an extremely serious medical condition called Reye\u2019s syndrome . Reye\u2019s syndrome is an illness that affects the brain and other internal organs. Always consult the child\u2019s health care provider before giving any over-the-counter pain relievers. If the child has a high fever , it is important to gently cool the child. Never rush cooling down a child. If the fever is caused a febrile seizure, rapid cooling could bring on other complications. Instead, remove any ex cessive clothing or blankets and sponge the child with lukewarm water. Do not use an ice water bath or rubbing alcohol to cool down the body. Both of these approaches are dangerous. Continue caring for the child or infant with a high fever as described above. Foreign Objects in the Nose If a child has an object in the nose, do not try to remove the object. Special lighting and instruments are necessary. It is important to go to a health care provider for removal of the object. Also, try to calm the child and parents as best as possible. ",
                "141": "Special Situations and Circumstances 141 Injury Injury is the number one cause of death for chil dren in the United States. Many of these deaths are the result of motor-vehicle crashes. The greatest dangers to a child involved in a motor-vehicle crash are airway obstruction and bleeding. Severe bleeding must be controlled as quickly as possible. A relatively small amount of blood lost by an adult is a large amount for a child or an infant to lose. Because a child\u2019s head is large and heavy in proportion to the rest of the body, the head is the area most often injured. A child injured as the result of force or a blow also may have damage to the organs in the abdominal and chest cavities. Such damage can cause severe internal bleeding. A child secured only by a lap belt may have serious abdominal or spinal injuries in a motor-vehicle crash. Try to \ufb01 nd out what happened because a severely injured child may not immediately show signals of injury. To avoid needless deaths of children caused by motor vehicle crashes, laws have been enacted requiring that children ride in the backseat of the car in approved safety seats or wearing safety belts (see the Appendix: Injury Prevention and Emergency Preparedness for detailed information on vehicle safety). As a result of these laws, more children\u2019s lives have been saved. You may have to check and care for an injured child while he or she is in a safety seat. A safety seat does not normally pose problems while you are checking a child. Leave the child in the seat if the seat has not been damaged. If the child is to be transported to a medical facility for examination, he or she often can be safely secured and transported in the safety seat. Meningitis Meningitis is a disease that occurs when the tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord become in\ufb02 amed. It is caused by viruses or bacteria. The bacterial form of the disease is less common but more serious. What to Look For Signals of meningitis include the following: \u25a0 Fever \u25a0 Irritability \u25a0 Loss of appetite \u25a0 Sleepiness \u25a0 In addition, older children may complain of a stiff neck, back pain or a headache. When to Seek Professional Medical Care A health care provider should be contacted if a child has been in contact with a person who has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis. The health care provider may prescribe preventative antibiotics. If the child shows any signals of meningitis, go immediately to a health care provider. It is important to \ufb01 nd out whether the illness is caused by bacteria or a virus. Bacterial meningitis requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. There is no medication to treat viral meningitis. Give supportive care for the fever and pain with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Poisoning Poisoning is one of the top 10 causes of unintentional death in the United States for adolescents, children and infants. Children younger than 6 years account for half of all exposures to poisonous substances in the United States. Children in this age group often are poisoned by ingesting household products or medications (typically those intended for adults). Although children in this age group are exposed more often than any other, only 3 percent of these cases result in death. There has been a decrease in child poisonings in recent years due in part to child-resistant packaging for medications. This packaging makes it harder for children to get into these substances. The decrease also is a result of preventive actions taken by parents and others who care for children. For more information on poisoning, refer to Chapter 5. Rashes Young children and infants have sensitive skin. Their skin develops rashes easily. Two common rashes in young children and infants are heat rash and diaper rash. Heat Rash Heat rash is a red or pink rash that forms on any skin covered by clothing. It is most common in infants and looks like red dots or small pimples. If the child or infant develops heat rash, give care by: \u25a0 Removing or loosening clothing to cool down the child or infant. \u25a0 Moving the child or infant to a cool location. \u25a0 Cooling the area with wet washcloths or a cool bath and letting the skin air-dry. If the area remains irritated, use calamine lotion or a hydrocortisone cream if the child is not sensitive or allergic to these products. Avoid ointments or other lotions. They could further irritate the skin. Diaper Rash Diaper rash is another common rash in young children and infants. When skin is wet for too long, it begins to break down. When wet skin is rubbed, it becomes more ",
                "142": "damaged. Moisture from a dirty diaper can harm the skin of a toddler or infant, making it more irritated. This causes diaper rash to develop. Seek care from a health care provider if diaper rash: \u25a0 Develops blisters or pus-\ufb01 lled sores. \u25a0 Does not go away within 2 to 3 days. \u25a0 Gets worse. Give care for diaper rash in toddlers and infants by applying a thick layer of over-the-counter zinc oxide or petroleum jelly to the affected area. This creates a barrier between the infant\u2019s delicate skin and the urine or feces. To prevent diaper rash and help it to heal: \u25a0 Keep the area as dry as possible by changing wet or soiled diapers immediately. \u25a0 Clean the area with water and a soft washcloth. Avoid wipes that can dry the child\u2019s skin. \u25a0 Pat the skin dry or let it air dry. \u25a0 Keep the diaper loose so wet and soiled parts do not rub against the skin. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of a seemingly healthy infant. In the United States, approximately 2300 infants die every year of SIDS. SIDS is the third leading cause of death for infants between 1 month and 1 year of age. It occurs most often in infants between 4 weeks and 7 months of age. SIDS usually occurs while the infant is sleeping. The condition does not seem to be linked to a disease. In addition, the cause(s) of SIDS are not yet understood. It is not thought to be hereditary, but it does tend to recur in families. Because of these factors, there is no way of knowing if a child is at risk for SIDS. Sometimes it is mistaken for child abuse because of the unexplained death in an apparently healthy child. In addition, SIDS sometimes causes bruise-like blotches to appear on the infant\u2019s body. However, SIDS is not related to child abuse. When to Call 9-1-1 By the time the infant\u2019s condition has been discovered, he or she may be in cardiac arrest. If you encounter an infant in this condition, make sure that someone has called 9-1-1 or the local emergency number or call yourself. What to Do Until Help Arrives If there is no breathing, perform CPR until EMS personnel take over, an automated external de\ufb01 brillator (AED) becomes available or you see an obvious sign of life, such as breathing. After a SIDS Incident An incident involving a severely ill child or infant or one who has died can be emotion ally upsetting. After such an episode, \ufb01 nd someone whom you trust to talk about the experience and express your feelings. If you continue to be distressed, seek professional counseling. The feelings caused by such incidents need to be dealt with and understood or they can result in serious stress reactions. EMERGENCY CHILDBIRTH Words such as exhausting, stressful, exciting, ful\ufb01 lling, painful and scary sometimes are used to describe a planned childbirth. A planned childbirth is one that occurs in the hospital or at home under the supervision of a health care provider. If you \ufb01 nd yourself assisting with the delivery of a newborn, however, it probably will not be happening in a planned situation. Therefore, your feelings, as well as those of the expectant mother, may be intensi\ufb01 ed by fear of the unexpected or the possibility that something might go wrong. FOCUS ON PREVENTION SIDS Infants who sleep on their stomach at night or naptime seem to have an increased risk for SIDS. Therefore, to help reduce the risk of SIDS: \u25a0 Always place an infant on his or her back at night or naptime, using a \ufb01 rm mattress in a safety-approved crib or bassinet. \u25a0 Make sure that there is no soft bedding, such as pillows, blankets and bumpers, or soft toys, such as stuffed animals, in the crib. These items could cause suffocation. \u25a0 Check the sleeping infant frequently. ",
                "143": "Special Situations and Circumstances 143 Take comfort in knowing that things rarely go wrong. Childbirth is a natural process. Thousands of children all over the world are born without complications each day, in areas where no medical care is available. When to Call 9-1-1 If a woman is giving birth, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. Give the EMS call taker the following important information: \u25a0 The woman\u2019s name, age and expected due date \u25a0 How long she has been having labor pains \u25a0 Whether this is her \ufb01 rst child What to Do Until Help Arrives By following a few simple steps, you can effectively assist in the birth process while you wait for EMS personnel to arrive. If a woman is giving birth: \u25a0 Talk with the woman to help her remain calm. \u25a0 Place layers of clean sheets, towels or blankets under her and over her abdomen. \u25a0 Control the scene so that the woman will have privacy. \u25a0 Position the woman on her back with her knees bent, feet \ufb02 at and legs spread wide apart. \u25a0 Avoid contact with body \ufb02 uids; wear disposable gloves and protective eyewear if possible. \u25a0 Remember, the woman delivers the baby, so be patient and let it happen naturally. \u25a0 The baby will be slippery; use a clean towel to receive and hold the baby; avoid dropping the baby. \u25a0 Keep the baby warm; have a clean, warm towel or blanket handy to wrap the newborn. CAUTIONS: \u25a0 Do not let the woman get up or leave to \ufb01 nd a bathroom (most women want to use the restroom). \u25a0 Do not hold the woman\u2019s knees together; this will not slow the birth process and may complicate the birth or harm the baby. \u25a0 Do not place your \ufb01 ngers in the vagina for any reason. \u25a0 Do not pull on the baby. OLDER ADULTS Older adults, or the elderly, generally are considered to be those older than 65 years. They are quickly becoming the fastest growing age group in the United States. Since 1900, life expectancy in the United States has increased by over 60 percent. In 1900, for example, the average life expectancy was 46 years for men and 48 years for women. Today, it is 75 years for men and 80 years for women. The main explanations for the increase in life expectancy are medical advancements and improvements in health care. Normal aging brings about changes. People age at different rates, and each person\u2019s organs and body parts age at different rates as well. For example, a person with wrinkled, fragile skin may have strong bones or excellent respiratory function. Overall, however, body function generally de clines as we age. Some changes begin as early as age 30 years. The lungs become less ef\ufb01 cient, so older people are at higher risk of developing pneu monia and other lung diseases. The amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat de creases, and the heart rate slows. The blood vessels harden, causing increased work for the heart. Hearing and vision usually decline, often causing some degree of sight and hearing loss. Re\ufb02 exes become slower, and arthritis may affect joints, causing movement to become painful. Checking an Older Adult The physical and mental changes associated with aging may require you to adapt your way of communicating and to be aware of certain potential age-related conditions, such as hearing loss. To check an injured or ill older adult, attempt to learn the person\u2019s name and use it when you speak to him or her. Consider using \u201cMrs.,\u201d \u201cMr.\u201d or \u201cMs.\u201d as a sign of respect. Make sure that you are at the person\u2019s eye level so that he or she can see and hear you more clearly (Fig. 9-3). If the person seems confused at \ufb01 rst, the confusion may be the result of impaired vision or hearing. If he or she usually wears eyeglasses and cannot \ufb01 nd them, try to locate them. Speak slowly and clearly, and look at the person\u2019s face while you talk. Notice if he or she has a hearing aid. Someone who needs glasses to see or a hearing aid to hear is likely to be very anxious without them. If the person is truly confused, try to \ufb01 nd out if the confusion is the result of the injury or an FIGURE 9-3 Speak to an elderly person at eye level so that he or she can see and hear you more clearly.

                "144": "existing condition. Be sure to get as much information as possible from family members or bystanders. The person may be afraid of falling, so if he or she is standing, offer an arm or hand. Remember that an older person may need to move slowly. Try to \ufb01 nd out what medications the person is taking so that you can tell EMS personnel. Look for a medical identi\ufb01 cation (ID) tag, bracelet or necklace that lists the person\u2019s name, address and medical information. Be aware that an elderly person may not recognize the signals of a serious condition. An elderly person also may minimize any signals for fear of losing his or her inde pendence or being placed in a nursing home. Common Injuries and Illnesses in Older Adults Certain problems are more prevalent in older adults, such as speci\ufb01 c kinds of injury and illness. The following sections discuss some of these concerns. Confusion Older adults are at increased risk of altered thinking patterns and confusion. Some of this change is the result of aging. Certain diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, affect the brain, resulting in im paired memory and thinking and altered behavior. Confusion that comes on suddenly, however, may be the result of medication, even a medication the person has been taking regularly. An injured or ill person who has problems seeing or hearing also may become confused when injured or ill. This problem increases when the person is in an unfamiliar environment. A head injury also can result in confusion. Confusion can be a signal of a medical emergency. An elderly person with pneumonia, for example, may not run a fever, have chest pain or be coughing, but because not enough oxygen is reaching the brain, the person may be confused. An older person can have a serious infection without fever, pain or nausea. An elderly person having a heart attack may not have chest pain, pale or ashen skin or other classic signals but may be restless, short of breath and confused. Depression is common in older adults. A depressed older adult may seem to be confused initially. A person suffering from depression also may show signals that have no apparent cause, such as sudden shortness of breath or chest pain. Whatever the reason for any the confusion, be respectful and do not talk down to or treat him or her like a child. Falls Older adults are at increased risk of falls. In fact, falls are the leading cause of death from injury for older adults. Falls in older adults are due to slower re\ufb02 exes, failing eyesight and hearing, arthritis and problems such as unsteady balance and movement. Falls frequently result in fractures because the bones become weaker and more brittle with age. Head Injuries An older adult is at greater risk of serious head injury. As we age, the size of the brain decreases. This decrease results in more space between the surface of the brain and the inside of the skull. This space allows more movement of the brain within the skull, which can increase the likelihood of serious head injury. Occasionally, an older adult may not develop the signals of a head injury until days after a fall. Therefore, unless you know the cause of a behavior change, you should always suspect a head injury as a possible cause of unusual behavior in an elderly person. This is especially true if you know that the person had a fall or a blow to the head. Problems with Heat and Cold An elderly person is more susceptible to extremes in temperature. The person may be unable to feel temperature extremes because his or her body may no longer regulate temperature effectively. Body temperature may change rapidly to a dangerously high or low level. The body of an elderly person retains heat be cause of a decreased ability to sweat and the re duced ability of the circulatory system to adjust to heat. This can lead to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. An elderly person may become chilled and suffer hypothermia simply by sitting in a draft or in front of a fan or air conditioner. Hypothermia can occur at any time of the year. People can go on for several days suffering from mild hypothermia without realizing it. The older person with mild hypothermia will want to lie down frequently; however, this will lower the body temperature even further. Giving Care for a Heat-Related Illness See Chapter 6 for information about caring for heat-related illnesses. Giving Care for a Cold-Related Emergency See Chapter 6 for information about caring for cold-related emergencies. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES According to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), a person with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities such as walking, talking, seeing, hearing or learning. This includes, for example, ",
                "145": "Special Situations and Circumstances 145 a blind person who cannot read information posted on a bulletin board or a deaf person who may need a sign language interpreter. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that over 33 million people in the United States have disabilities. When giving care to people with disabilities, communication can be a challenge. It may be dif\ufb01 cult to \ufb01 nd out what has happened and what might be wrong in an emergency situation. Physical Disability A person is considered to have a physical disability if his or her ability to move (also called motor function ) is impaired. A person also is considered to have a physically disability if his or her sensory function is impaired. Sensory function includes all of the senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. A person with a physical disability may have impairments in motor function, sensory function or both. General hints for approaching an injured or ill person whom you suspect may have a physical disability include: \u25a0 Speak to the person before touching him or her. \u25a0 Ask, \u201cHow can I help?\u201d or \u201cDo you need help?\u201d \u25a0 Ask for assistance and information from the person who has the disability\u2014he or she has been living with the disability and best under stands it. If you are not able to communicate with the person, ask family members, friends or companions who are available to help. \u25a0 Do not remove any braces, canes, other physical support, eyeglasses or hearing aids. Removal of these items may take away necessary physical support for the person\u2019s body. \u25a0 Look for a medical ID tag, bracelet or necklace at the person\u2019s wrist or neck. \u25a0 A person with a disability may have a service animal, such as a guide or signal dog. Be aware that this animal may be protective of the person in an emergency situation. Allow the animal to stay with the person if possible, which will help to reassure both of them. Deaf and Hard of Hearing Hearing loss is de\ufb01 ned as a partial or total loss of hearing. Some people are born with a hearing loss. Hearing loss also can result from an injury or illness affecting the ear, the nerves leading from the brain to the ear or the brain itself. You may not immediately realize that the injured or ill person has a hearing loss. Often the person will tell you, either in speech or by pointing to the ear and shaking the head no. Some people carry a card stating that they have a hearing loss. You may see a hearing aid in a person\u2019s ear. The biggest obstacle you must overcome in car ing for a person with a hearing loss is communication. You will need to \ufb01 gure out how to get that person\u2019s consent to give care, and you will need to assess the problem. Sometimes the injured or ill person will be able to read lips. To assist him or her, position yourself where the person can clearly see your face. Look straight at the person while you speak, and speak slowly. Do not exaggerate the way you form words. Do not turn your face away while you speak. Many people with a hearing impairment, however, do not read lips. In these cases, using gestures and writing messages on paper may be the most effective way to communicate. If you and the person know sign language, use it. Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing have a machine called a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD). You can use this device to type messages and questions, and the person can type replies back to you (Fig. 9-4, A\u2013B). Many people who have a hearing FIGURE 9-4, A\u2013B Communicate with a person who has a hearing loss in the best way possible. A, Use sign language, lip reading or writing to communicate. B, You may also use a telecommunications device for the deaf. A B ",
                "146": "impairment can speak, some distinctly, some not so clearly. If you have trouble understanding, ask the person to repeat what he or she said. Do not pretend to understand. Blind or Visually Impaired Vision loss is a partial or total loss of sight. Vision loss can have many causes. Some people are born with vision loss. Others lose vision as a result of dis ease or injury. Vision loss is not necessarily a prob lem with the eyes. It can result from problems with the vision centers in the brain. It is no more dif\ufb01 cult to communicate verbally with a person who has a partial or total loss of sight than with someone who can see. You do not need to speak loudly or in overly simple terms. The person may not be able to tell you certain things about how an injury occurred but usually can give an accurate account based on his or her interpretation of sound and touch. When caring for a person with vision loss, help to reassure him or her by explaining what is going on and what you are doing. If you must move a visually impaired person who can walk, stand beside the person and have him or her hold onto your arm. Walk at a normal pace, alert the person to obstacles in the way, such as stairs, and let the person know whether to step up or down. If the person has a service animal, try to keep them together. Ask the person to tell you how to handle the dog or ask him or her to do it. Motor Impairment A person with motor impairment is unable to move normally. He or she may be missing a body part or have a problem with the bones or muscles or the nerves that control movement. Causes of motor im pairment could include stroke, muscular dystrophy, mul tiple sclerosis, paralysis, cerebral palsy or loss of a limb. Determining which problems are pre-existing and which are the result of immediate injury or illness can be dif\ufb01 cult. Care for all problems you detect as if they are new. Mental Impairment Mental, or cognitive, function includes the brain\u2019s capacity to reason and process information. A person with a mental impairment has problems per forming these operations. Some types of mental impairment are genetic. Others result from injuries or infections that occur during pregnancy, shortly after birth or later in life. Some causes never are determined. In some situations, you will not be able to determine if a person has a mental impairment; in others, it will be obvious. If you suspect that a person has a mental impairment, approach him or her as you would any other person in his or her age group. If the person appears not to understand you, rephrase what you were saying in simpler terms. Listen carefully to what the person says. An injury or a sudden illness can be disruptive to some individuals who have a cognitive impairment, causing them a great deal of anxiety and fear. Take time to explain who you are and what you are going to do. Offer reassurance. Try to gain the person\u2019s trust. If a parent, guardian or caregiver is present, ask that person to help you give care to the person. People with certain types of mental illness might misinterpret your actions as being hostile. If the scene becomes unsafe, you may need to remove yourself from the immediate area. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and explain your concerns about a potential psychiatric emergency. If possible, keep track of the person\u2019s location and what he or she is doing. Report this information to the emergency responders. LANGUAGE BARRIERS Getting consent to give care to a person with whom you have a language barrier can be a problem. Find out if any bystanders speak the person\u2019s language and can help to translate. Do your best to communicate nonverbally. Use gestures and facial expressions. If the person is in pain, he or she probably will be anxious to show you where the pain is located. Watch his or her gestures and facial expressions carefully. When you speak to the person, speak slowly and in a normal tone. The person probably will have no trouble hearing you. When you call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, explain that you are having dif\ufb01 culty communicating with the person and tell the call taker which language you believe the person speaks. The EMS system may have someone available who can help with communication. If the person has a life-threatening condition, such as severe bleeding, consent is implied. CRIME SCENES AND HOSTILE SITUATIONS In certain situations, such as a giving care to a person in a crime scene or an injured person who is hostile, you will need to use extreme caution. Although your \ufb01 rst reaction may be to go to the aid of a person, in these situations you should call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and stay at a safe distance. ",
                "147": "Special Situations and Circumstances 147 Do not enter the scene of a suicide. If you happen to be on the scene when an unarmed person threatens suicide, call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number. Do not argue with the person. Remain at a safe distance. Leave or avoid entering any area considered to be a crime scene, such as one where there is a weapon, or the scene of a physical or sexual assault. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number and stay at a safe distance. You may encounter a situation where there is a hostile or angry person. A person\u2019s rage or hostility may be caused by the injury, pain or fear. Some individuals, afraid of losing control, may act resentful and suspicious. Hostile behavior also may result from the use of alcohol or other drugs, a lack of oxygen or a medical condition. If a person refuses your care or threatens you, remove yourself from the situation and stay at a safe distance. Never argue with or restrain an injured or ill person. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if someone has not already done so. Never put your own safety at risk. Uninjured family members also may display anger. This anger may stem from panic, anxiety or guilt. Try to remain calm and explain what you plan to do in giving emergency care. If pos sible, \ufb01 nd a way that family members can help, such as by comforting the person. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER It is important to be aware of the special needs and considerations of children and infants, older adults, people with disabilities and people who speak a different language than your own. In rare circumstances, you could \ufb01 nd yourself in a position to give help in an emergency childbirth or help an older person who has become suddenly ill. Knowing what to do in these types of situations will help you to act calmly and give the right care. Interacting and communicating with all types of people in many different situations will enable you to respond quickly and effectively in an emergency. ",

                "149": "Asthma 149 ASTHMA Asthma is an illness in which certain substances or conditions, called \u201ctriggers,\u201d cause in\ufb02 ammation and constriction of the airways (small tubes in the lungs through which we breathe), making breathing dif\ufb01 cult. Triggers of an asthma attack include exercise, cold air, allergens or irritants, such as perfume. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that over 23 million Americans were affected by asthma. Asthma is more common in children and young adults. However, its frequency and severity is increasing in all age groups in the United States. Asthma is the third-ranking cause of hospitalization among those younger than 15 years. People diagnosed with asthma can reduce the risk of an attack by controlling environmental variables when possible. This helps to limit exposure to the triggers that can start an asthma attack. When an attack does occur, they can use medications and other forms of treatment. Asthma medications stop the muscle spasm and open the airway, which makes breathing easier. Asthma Triggers A trigger is anything that sets off or starts an asthma attack. A trigger for one person is not necessarily a trigger for another. Asthma triggers include the following: \u25a0 Dust and smoke \u25a0 Air pollution \u25a0 Respiratory infections \u25a0 Fear or anxiety \u25a0 Perfume \u25a0 Exercise \u25a0 Plants and molds \u25a0 Medications, such as aspirin \u25a0 Animal dander \u25a0 Temperature extremes \u25a0 Changes in weather These are only a few of the things that can trigger asthma in people. Preventing Asthma Attacks Prevention is key. A person can follow these preventative measures to reduce his or her risk of an attack: \u25a0 Limit triggers in the home. \u25a0 Control emotions. \u25a0 Prevent infections. \u25a0 Reduce environmental triggers. \u25a0 Exercise carefully . Limiting Triggers in the Home You can reduce the chances of triggering an asthma attack at home by: \u25a0 Keeping plants outside. \u25a0 Washing bedclothes and pajamas weekly in hot water. \u25a0 Using hypoallergenic covers on mattresses and pillows. \u25a0 Eliminating or reducing the number of carpets and rugs. \u25a0 Regularly steam cleaning all carpets, rugs and upholstery. \u25a0 Keeping the home clean and free of dust and pests\u2014wet dusting can be more effective than dry dusting. \u25a0 Not allowing, or being around, smoke. \u25a0 Regularly changing the air \ufb01 lter in the central air conditioning or heating unit. \u25a0 Eliminating or minimizing the number of stuffed toys. \u25a0 Using hypoallergenic health and beauty products. \u25a0 Washing pets weekly. \u25a0 Keeping pets outside of the house. Controlling Emotions Certain strong emotions can trigger an asthma attack. When you feel a strong emotion, such as anger or fear, the following suggestions can reduce the chances that the emotions will trigger an asthma attack: \u25a0 Take a long deep breath in through the nose and slowly let it out through the mouth. \u25a0 Count to 10. \u25a0 Talk with a family member, trusted friend or health care provider. \u25a0 Do a relaxing activity. Preventing Infections Colds and other respiratory infections can make an asthma condition worse. One of the most common ways to catch colds is by rubbing the nose or eyes with hands contaminated with a cold virus. Contamination often occurs by touching surfaces (such as doorknobs) or objects that other people have touched. Some ways to reduce the chances of getting a cold or other respiratory infection include: \u25a0 Washing hands regularly, especially after using the restroom or shaking hands with other people and before eating. ",
                "150": "Cleaning environmental surfaces, such as telephones and counters, with a virus-killing disinfectant. The viruses that cause colds can survive up to 3 hours on objects such as telephones, counters and stair railings. Disinfecting them regularly can help to prevent the spread of colds and viruses. \u25a0 Getting vaccinated for illnesses when a vaccine is available, such as for in\ufb02 uenza and whooping cough (pertussis). Your health care provider might have other suggestions based on your medical history. Reducing Environmental Triggers Sudden changes in the weather, heavy mold or pollen content in the air and pollution can trigger an asthma attack. To avoid attacks brought on by triggers in the environment: \u25a0 Wear the right clothing for the weather conditions. \u25a0 Stay indoors on days when there is a high risk of respiratory trouble. \u25a0 Take preventative medications, as prescribed by your health care provider. \u25a0 Stay away from places with high amounts of dirt, smoke and other irritants. \u25a0 Know how the weather affects your condition. \u25a0 Talk to your health care provider about other prevention strategies. Exercising Carefully Exercise-induced asthma happens during or shortly after exercise. Having this type of asthma does not mean one cannot or should not exercise or play sports. It is, however, important to know what to do to prevent an asthma attack. Things to keep in mind when you have exercise-induced asthma include the following: \u25a0 Take prescribed medications 30 to 60 minutes before exercising. \u25a0 Slowly warm up before exercising. Cool down gently after exercising. \u25a0 Make sure that you drink plenty of \ufb02 uids during exercise. \u25a0 Seek and follow the advice of your health care provider. \u25a0 If participating in organized sports, notify the coach of your condition. Using Medications to Control Asthma People who have been diagnosed with asthma will have a personalized medication plan. They should take all medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. Asthma medications are available in two forms: long-term control and quick relief. Long-Term Control Medications Long-term control medications prevent or reverse in\ufb02 ammation (swelling) in the airway. They also help to decrease sensitivity, which helps to keep the airways from reacting to asthma triggers. The long-term control medicines work slowly. They help to control asthma over many hours. They should be taken every day whether or not signals of asthma are present. Quick-Relief Medications Quick-relief or rescue medications are used to stop an asthma attack. These medications work quickly to relieve the sudden swelling. They lessen wheezing, coughing and chest tightness. This allows the person to breathe easier. They also are called short-acting bronchodilators. Methods of Delivery The most common way to take long-term control and quick-relief asthma medications is by inhaling them. Inhalation allows the medication to reach the airways faster and work quickly. There also are fewer side effects. Medications are inhaled using a metered dose inhaler (MDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a small-volume nebulizer (Fig. 10-1). Both long-term and quick-relief medications also are available in pill and liquid form. In addition, long-term medications are available in the form of an injection given just under the skin. FIGURE 10-1 Long-term and quick-release medications are inhaled using an MDI, a DPI or a small-volume nebulizer. ",
                "151": "Asthma 151 MDI An MDI sends a measured dose of medicine in mist form directly into the person\u2019s mouth. The person gently presses down the top of the inhaler. This causes a small amount of pressurized gas to push the medicine out quickly. Sometimes a \u201cspacer\u201d is used to control the amount of medication that is inhaled. The medicine goes into the spacer and then the person inhales the medication through the mouthpiece on the spacer. DPI A DPI is similar to an MDI. It is a hand-held device that delivers a dry powder form of the medication. Some dry powders are tasteless. Others are mixed with lactose to give them a sweet taste. The DPI is administered by breathing in quickly to activate the inhaler. The person does not have to press down the top of the inhaler. DPIs may be dif\ufb01 cult for some people to use because of the need to take in a quick, strong breath. Small-Volume Nebulizers Small-volume nebulizers deliver medication in the form of a mist. The mist is delivered over several minutes. This is especially helpful when the person is unable to take deep breaths. Nebulizers are commonly used for children younger than 5 years and the elderly. They also are used for people who have trouble using inhalers and for those with severe asthma. What to Look For You often can tell when a person is having an asthma attack by the hoarse whistling sound made while exhaling. This sound, known as wheezing , occurs because air becomes trapped in the lungs. Coughing after exercise, crying or laughing are other signals that an asthma attack could begin. Signals of an asthma attack include: \u25a0 Trouble breathing or shortness of breath. \u25a0 Rapid, shallow breathing. \u25a0 Sweating. \u25a0 Tightness in the chest. \u25a0 Inability to talk without stopping for a breath. \u25a0 Feelings of fear or confusion. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the person\u2019s breathing trouble does not improve in a few minutes after using the quick-relief medication. What to Do Until Help Arrives Remain calm. This will help the person to remain calm and ease breathing troubles. Help the person to sit comfortably (Fig. 10-2). Loosen any tight clothing around the neck and abdomen. Assist the person with his or her prescribed quick-relief medication if requested and if permitted by state or local regulations. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Asthma is a life-long lung disease that affects millions of adults and children in the United States. Asthma can be controlled. Knowing the triggers for asthma and how to limit those triggers, and taking prescribed medications as directed can help to prevent an asthma attack. It is important to be prepared to help people with breathing emergencies caused by asthma. The \ufb01 rst step is to know the signals of an asthma attack. When you recognize the signals, act quickly and give appropriate care. Your care could help to save the life of a person with asthma.

                "155": "Anaphylaxis and Epinephrine Auto-Injectors 155 ANAPHYLAXIS Every year in the United States, between 400 and 800 deaths are caused by anaphylaxis. Respond quickly if a person is exposed to an antigen \u2014a foreign substance that brings on an allergic reaction. Fortunately, some deaths can be prevented if anaphylaxis is recognized immediately and cared for quickly. Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions are caused by the activity of the immune system . The body recognizes and protects itself from antigens by producing antibodies. These antibodies \ufb01 ght antigens. Antibodies are found in the liver, bone marrow, spleen and lymph glands. When the immune system recognizes an antigen, it releases chemicals to \ufb01 ght these foreign substances and eliminate them from the body. Antigens that cause an allergic reaction\u2014are called allergens . Allergic reactions range from mild to very severe. A common mild reaction is skin irritation from contact with poison ivy. A severe, life-threatening reaction is swelling of the airway, trouble breathing and an obstructed airway. Some common allergens include bee or insect venom, certain antibiotics, pollen, animal dander and sulfa drugs. Over 12 million people in the United States have food allergies. Every year there are over 30,000 cases of food- related anaphylaxis. Certain types of food commonly cause an allergic reaction in individuals with sensitivities to those foods. Peanuts and tree nuts cause the most cases of fatal and near-fatal allergic reactions to food. Other common food allergens include cow\u2019s milk, eggs, seafood (especially shell\ufb01 sh), soy and wheat. What to Look For Anaphylaxis usually occurs suddenly, within seconds or minutes after contact with the substance. The skin or area of the body that comes in contact with the substance usually swells and turns red (Fig. 11-1). Other signals include the following: \u25a0 Dif\ufb01 culty breathing, wheezing or shortness of breath \u25a0 Tight feeling in the chest and throat \u25a0 Swelling of the face, throat or tongue \u25a0 Weakness, dizziness or confusion \u25a0 Rash or hives \u25a0 Low blood pressure \u25a0 Shock Trouble breathing can progress to a blocked airway due to swelling of the lips, tongue, throat and larynx (voice box). Low blood pressure and shock may accompany these reactions. Death from anaphylaxis may happen because the person\u2019s breathing is severely restricted. When to Call 9-1-1 Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number if the person: \u25a0 Has trouble breathing. \u25a0 Complains of the throat tightening. \u25a0 Explains that he or she is subject to severe allergic reactions. \u25a0 Is or becomes unconscious. What to Do Until Help Arrives If you suspect anaphylaxis, and have called 9-1-1 or the local emergency number, follow these guidelines for giving care: \u25a0 Monitor the person\u2019s breathing and for changes in his or her condition. \u25a0 Give care for life-threatening emergencies. \u25a0 Check a conscious person to determine: { The substance (antigen) involved. { The route of exposure to the antigen. { The effects of the exposure. If the person is conscious and is able to talk , ask: { What is your name? { What happened? { How do you feel? { Do you feel any tingling in your hands, feet or lips? { Do you feel pain anywhere? { Do you have any allergies? Do you have prescribed medications to take in case of an allergic reaction? { Do you know what triggered the reaction? FIGURE 11-1 In anaphylaxis, air passages can swell, restricting breathing. ",
                "156": "How much and how long were you exposed? { Do you have any medical conditions or are you taking any medications? Quickly check the person from head to toe . Visually inspect the body: { Observe for signals of anaphylaxis including respiratory distress. { Look for a medical identi\ufb01 cation (ID) tag, bracelet or necklace. Check the person\u2019s head . { Look for swelling of the face, neck or tongue. { Notice if the person is drowsy, not alert, confused or exhibiting slurred speech. Check skin appearance . Look at person\u2019s face and lips. Ask yourself, is the skin: { Cold or hot? { Unusually wet or dry? { Pale, ashen, bluish or \ufb02 ushed? Check the person\u2019s breathing . { Ask if he or she is experiencing pain during breathing. { Notice rate, depth of breaths, wheezes or gasping sounds. Care for respiratory distress . { Help the person to rest in the most comfortable position for breathing, usually sitting. { Calm and reassure the person. \u25a0 Assist the person with using a prescribed epinephrine auto-injector, if available and if permitted by state regulations. \u25a0 Document any changes in the person\u2019s condition over time. Assisting with an Epinephrine Auto-Injector People who know they are extremely allergic to certain substances usually try to avoid them. However, sometimes this is impossible. These people may carry an anaphylaxis kit in case of a severe allergic reaction. These kits are available by prescription only. They contain a dose (or two) of the drug epinephrine. This drug works in the body to counteract the anaphylactic reaction. Two injectable epinephrine systems are available: the Epi-Pen \u00ae , which includes one dose; and Twinject \u00ae , which includes two doses (Fig. 11-2, A\u2013B). The instructions provided by the manufacturer and health care provider always FIGURE 11-2, A\u2013B A , An Epi-Pen\u00ae is preloaded with a single dose of the drug epinephrine. B , A Twinject\u00ae is preloaded with a double dose of epinephrine. A B ",
                "157": "Anaphylaxis and Epinephrine Auto-Injectors 157 should be followed when assisting someone with their prescribed epinephrine auto-injector. A second dose should not be given unless recommended by advanced medical personnel or in extremely unusual circumstances, where advanced medical care is not available or is signi\ufb01 cantly delayed and signals of anaphylaxis persist after a few minutes. Note : Only the person having the reaction should self-administer the second dose included with the Twinject \u00ae injector . An auto-injector contains a preloaded dose of 0.3 mg of epinephrine for adults or 0.15 mg of epinephrine for children weighing 33 to 66 pounds. The injector has a spring-loaded plunger. When activated, it injects the epinephrine. The auto-injector is activated when it is forcefully pushed against the skin. It should be used on a muscular area, usually the person\u2019s mid-outer thigh (Fig. 11-3). The injector needs to stay in place for 10 seconds. This allows the medication to fully empty. When the auto-injector is removed, handle it carefully and do not touch the needle if it is exposed. If a person is conscious and able to use the auto-injector, help him or her in any way asked. If you know that a person has a prescribed auto-injector and is unable to administer it him- or herself, then you may help the person use it where allowed by state or local laws or regulations. Remember, for a person experiencing anaphylaxis, time is of the essence. Helping the Person Self-Administer an Antihistamine Some anaphylaxis kits also contain an antihistamine in pill form. An antihistamine is a type of medication. It lessens the effects of compounds released by the body during an allergic reaction. The person should read and follow all medication labels. It also is important for the person to follow any instructions given by the health care provider. Check state and local regulations about assisting someone with the use of prescription and over-the-counter medications. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency. Knowing how to give immediate care and help someone use an epinephrine auto-injector could mean the difference between life and death. FIGURE 11-3 Forcefully pushing the auto-injector against the skin activates the device. It should be used on a muscular area, usually the person\u2019s mid-outer thigh. ",
                "158": "ASSISTING WITH AN EPINEPHRINE AUTO-INJECTOR Determine whether the person has already taken epinephrine or antihistamine. If so, administer a second dose only when EMS personnel are not present or delayed and if signals of anaphylaxis persist after a few minutes. Check the label to con\ufb01 rm that the prescription of the auto-injector is for this person. Check the expiration date of the auto-injector. If it has expired, DO NOT USE IT. If the medication is visible, con\ufb01 rm that the liquid is clear and not cloudy. If it is cloudy, DO NOT USE IT. SKILL SHEET NOTE: If possible, help the person self-administer the auto-injector. TO CARE FOR A CONSCIOUS PERSON WHO IS UNABLE TO SELF-ADMINISTER THE AUTO-INJECTOR, AND LOCAL OR STATE REGULATIONS ALLOW: LOCATE INJECTION SITE Locate the outside middle of one thigh to use as the injection site. NOTE: If injecting through clothing, press on the area with a hand to determine that there are no obstructions at the injection site, such as keys, coins, the side seam of trousers, etc. REMOVE SAFETY CAP Grasp the auto-injector \ufb01 rmly in your \ufb01 st, and pull off the safety cap with your other hand.
